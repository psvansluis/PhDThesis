\chapter{Introduction — phonology}
\label{cha:introduction-phonology}
In Modern Welsh, voiceless stops — \mw{p, t, c} — are lenited to \mw{b, d, g}.  This thesis argues that these lenited voiceless  stops (\lT)  did not initially merge with unlenited voiced stops — \mw{b, d, g} (\xD). The thesis is divided in two parts, and Part~\ref{part:phonology-phonetics}  treats which phonological variables kept these sounds apart in Welsh, while Part~\ref{part:orthography} addresses the date when \lT\ and \xD\ separated. This chapter introduces the concept of lenition and some of the history of scholarship on lenition in Celtic, focusing on the idea that \lT\ did not equal \xD\ word-initially in Brittonic. This chapter concludes this literature review by introducing my own reconstruction of how \xT, \lT, and \xD\ were kept apart in post-apocope Brittonic. I argue that \lT\ and \xD\ were still separate in Welsh  until halfway through the Middle Ages, and that the phonetic variables keeping these phonemes apart are recoverable.


All present-day Celtic languages share grammatical lenition, whereby the first consonant of a word may change into a more sonorous one as a result of its morphosyntactic environment; however the way in which a consonant is made into a more sonorous one differs between the Goidelic\footnote{The Goidelic languages comprise Old Irish and its descendants Irish, Scottish and Manx Gaelic.} and the Brittonic\footnote{The Brittonic languages comprise Welsh, Cornish and Breton.} branches of Celtic. In Goidelic, all stop consonants turn into their fricative counterparts, while present-day Brittonic voiceless stops turn into their voiced counterparts and voiced stops turn into their respective fricatives. Table~\ref{tab:lenitionwelshirish} shows the differing treatments between Brittonic and Goidelic using Modern Welsh and Old Irish as examples.

The shaded areas in Table~\ref{tab:lenitionwelshirish} highlight a merger in Welsh. Judging from their Old Irish counterparts alone we can see that lenited voiceless stops  and radical voiced stops  must at some point have been separate in Brittonic as well.


\section{A two-stage development of lenition}
\label{sec:two-stage-devel}
Goidelic and Brittonic both have the morphological instrument of lenition, but the phonemes used to express lenition differ. To account for Goidelic and Brittonic in a unified theory would require several steps. Yet early scholars of Welsh  frequently described lenition as just one sound law. An example of a historical grammar of Welsh describing lenition as such is \textcite{Mor_Welsh13}, who summarises lenition as follows:
\tqt{Brit.\ and Lat. \textit{p, t, k, b, d, g, m} between vowels became \textit{b, d, g, f, δ, ᵹ, f} respectively in W.}{Mor_Welsh13}{§~103}
This description gives a correct summary the totality of changes between \gls{pc} and \gls{mow}, but does not separate these changes  into intermediate stages. 
When he posits that present-day Brittonic languages /p t k/ lenite to /b d ɡ/, he makes two claims: the first is that lenition was applied to voiceless stops at some point in the history of Brittonic; the second is that the phonemes to which these voiceless stops lenited were merged with the pre-existing phonemes /b d ɡ/. These two developments may be taken together by scholars of \eg Welsh, because that is the final result in present-day Brittonic; however, failing to separate these two developments  creates a few problems.

One obvious problem is that if the two Brittonic developments occurred as a single development, then lenition in Goidelic and Brittonic cannot be described as a single development, because Goidelic voiceless stops lenite into /f θ x/, and it is hard to derive the Goidelic  voiceless fricatives from the Brittonic voiced stops, or vice versa. Another problem is Brittonic-internal. If voiceless stops after lenition came to equal unlenited voiced stops immediately, then would these not have to be lenited into lenited voiced stops in turn? This issue was recognised  by \textcite{loth_les_1892}, who proposed that voiceless stops underwent lenition at a later date than other consonants:
\tqt{\textfrench{Les explosives sonores \textit{b, d, g}, entre deux voyelles ont dû \textit{commencer} leur mouvement vers les spirantes correspondantes, avant que les explosives sourdes, \textit{p, t, c} ne fussent devenues \textit{b, d, g}; autrement, celles-ci auraient eu le même sort qu'elles. Si le latin \textit{opera} avait donné \textit{obera} au moment où \textit{labore} était encore \textit{labure}, le \textit{b} d'\textit{ober} eût été traité comme celui de \textit{labur}; c'est-à-dire fût devenu \textit{v}; on aurait aujourd'hui \textit{over, lavur} et non \textit{ober, lavur}. Des trois explosives sonores, \textit{g} paraît la première être devenue spirante.}\footnote{The voiced stops \textit{b, d, g} between two vowels should have \emph{started} their movement towards their corresponding spirants before the voiceless stops became \textit{b, d, g}; otherwise, these ones would have had the same fate as those. If Latin \textit{opera} had given \textit{obera} at the moment when \textit{labore} was still \textit{labure}, the \textit{b} of \textit{ober} would have been treated as the one of \textit{labur}; \ie it would have become \textit{v}; today we would have \textit{over, lavur} and not \textit{ober, lavur}. Of the three voiced stops, \textit{g} seems to be the first to have become a spirant.}}{loth_les_1892}{87}
Loth's explanation accounts for why there is no such thing as /p/ > /b/ > /v/, but his theory also sacrifices the unity of lenition. Lenition may be described as a single process whereby intervocalic consonants become more sonorous, so it would be less simple to suggest two separate events of lenition, where some consonants were lenited at one point, and other consonants at another. His account does solve the issue of Goidelic lenition:  lenited voiceless stops to voiceless spirants could be just one more independent development of lenition. Yet by now we must assume three independent events to account for all the lenition in Goidelic and Brittonic.

\Textcite[162]{Foer_Flussname41} and \Textcite{sims-williams_dating_1990} also argue for two separate stages of lenition, with /p t k/ undergoing lenition at a later date than other consonants.
% \tqt{I shall argue that `lenition' — the conventional name for the spirantization of [b d g m] > [β δ γ μ] and voicing of [p t k] > [b d g] — occurred in two distinct stages: (1) spirantization, then (2) voicing […]. This will seem heretical to Brittonicists, who instinctively regard [t] > [d], etc., and [d] > [δ], etc., as a single phenomenon because they constitute the morphophonemic alternation of `lenition' or `soft mutation'.}{sims-williams_dating_1990}{221}
They both apply Loth's line of reasoning that /p t k/ cannot have preceded other consonants because that would have led to these consonants being lenited twice over~\autocite[\eg][232]{sims-williams_dating_1990}. This shows that lenition of voiceless stops is often silently equated with the merger of lenited voiceless stops with radical voiced stops. Förster's argument is rejected by \textcite[§~131]{jackson_language_1953}, who argues that original \pbr{b, d, g} in leniting position could well have shifted towards fricatives at the same time as \pbr{p, t, k} was shifting towards \pbr{b, d, g}. \Textcite[5]{Tho_Brythonic90} argues that Jackson's scenario would have led to `a certain amount of inappropriate feeding and bleeding', but \textcite[243]{Rus_Introduction95} notes that such feeding and bleeding could not possibly have happened, because that would have resulted in lexical chaos. In my view, Jackson meant to describe a chain shift, which is a well-known cross-linguistic phenomenon that does not necessarily cause feeding and bleeding. In a chain-shift scenario, intervocalic /p/ and /b/ would shift at the same time in a push chain or a drag chain. If we allow for chain shifts, Loth and Förster only demonstrate that voicing of voiceless stops did not occur before the moment when lenited voiced stops became fricatives, but not necessarily that the voicing of lenited voiceless stops occurred afterwards.  Sims-Williams' argument also rests on early loanwords from Brittonic into Goidelic, but this analysis is rejected by \textcite{isaac_chronology_2004}, because Sims-Williams conflates the roles  phonetics and phonology play in the process of loaning\footnote{The mistake  \textcite{sims-williams_dating_1990} makes is that he attempts to gain insight into Brittonic phonology from loanwords into Goidelic, but loaning chiefly involves the phonetics of the source language being interpreted by the phonology of the target language.}.

Not all lenited consonants differ between Goidelic and Brittonic. Lenited voiced stops, for example, became voiced fricatives in both branches. It would be simpler to posit a scenario where the common ancestor of these branches also had the lenited allophones of \gls{D} realised as fricatives. In such a scenario, the date at which lenited allophones of \gls{T} were realised as voiceless fricatives in Goidellic and as voiced stops in Brittonic must be uncoupled from the date lenited allophones of \gls{D} became fricatives. However, in such a scenario, \gls{T} would still be expected to have both radical and lenited allophones.  After these considerations, a two-stage development of lenited consonants may be posited, but the change occurring in two stages is not the creation of radical and lenited allophones, or the resulting phonemicisation thereof, but the precise realisation of these lenited consonants. The first stage in the revised scenario includes the realisation of lenited allophones of \gls{D} as fricatives, and the second stage  comprises the different realisations of \lT\ in Brittonic and Goidelic. This theory requires identification of the allophone that could yield both Goidelic and Brittonic \lT.

\Textcite{Ped_Aspirationen97} proposes a complex, all-inclusive theory that attempts  to relate  Goidelic  fricatives to Brittonic voiced stops, and even brings Brittonic spirantisation — the voiceless fricatives descending from geminates — into the mix, but the theory has found few supporters\footnote{His theory, especially the Brittonic part, is described as `obscure' and rejected in a review by~\textcite{Str_Erschienene99}.}. A later evolution of his theory can be found in a short note in  \textcite[§§~149,~303]{Ped_Vergleichende09}, where he proposes the following three-way opposition (summarised in Table~\ref{tab:pedersenstops}) for the shared ancestor of Goidelic and Brittonic: \xT\ was voiceless aspirated, \lT\ was voiceless, but unaspirated, and \xD\ was voiced\footnote{\Textcite{LP_Concise37} are silent about three-way stop oppositions altogether~\autocite[§~131]{jackson_language_1953}.}.

\end{table}


Even though Pedersen's theory as a whole never found traction, he is not the only scholar to propose this three-way distinction:
\tqt{In Britannic single stops underwent a change of character after vowels. Probably in all dialects the voiceless stops […] first became unaspirated lenes, which were then voiced […] at an early period in some dialects. The old voiced stops […], on the other hand, became spirants […]. In Irish, on the other hand, single \textit{c} and \textit{t} after vowels in native words turn into the spirants \textit{ch} and \textit{th} […], which in certain circumstances become voiced \textit{ɣ} and \textit{δ}.}{Thu_grammar46}{§~915}
Thurneysen proposes this system  to explain how the phonology of Brittonic and British Latin influenced the stop orthography of Old Irish, but his proposal also presents  a viable common ancestor of the Goidelic and Brittonic lenited voiceless stops. However, Thurneysen makes no statement on what period of time  \lT\ and \xD\ were pronounced differently in Brittonic, and there is no evidence that he conceives of them as separate phonemes rather than pre-apocope allophones.

\section{Lenition and gemination}
\label{sec:martinet}

\Textcite{martinet_celtic_1952} describes how lenition arose in Insular Celtic and Western Romance, and connects lenition to the feature of gemination, which is the existence of doubled consonants such as \lat{-cc-} in \glat[cheek]{bucca}. These doubled consonants are pronounced longer than their single counterparts. Thus, gemination leads to phonemic consonant length. Martinet then describes lenition as the replacement of the opposition between single and double consonants with an opposition between short and long consonants. Then, every consonant may be articulated in two different ways: as a weaker articulation in intervocalic contexts and as its original articulation in non-leniting contexts including in originally geminated clusters. Crucially, this development does not entail the creation of new phonemes, so no new distinctions may be expressed as a result~\autocite[192]{martinet_celtic_1952}.

It is only following syncope and apocope — the loss of some internal and all final syllables — that we may speak of lenited phonemes rather than allophones, \ie lenition as a morphophonemic aspect of the Celtic languages. The term `lenition' has been used to refer to either or both processes, yet `the use of the same word to designate two synchronically quite different phenomena is apt to create confusion'~\autocite[193–194]{martinet_celtic_1952}.

The phonetic stage of lenition obviously occurred before the stage when it became phonemic, but Martinet is unsure how much earlier. Lenition may either be considered an early \acrlong{pc} development, or a later Pan-Celtic areal feature developing because of parallel development. Such a parallel development could be the result of a common substrate or spread from one dialect to another. He leans towards a Pan-Celtic scenario, because of the problem of different treatments of \lT\ in Goidelic and Brittonic where intervocalic \pc{-t-} ultimately yields [θ] in Goidelic, but [d] in Brittonic. It is difficult to infer [d] from [θ] or vice versa. Yet he then notes:
\tqt{But this of course is not decisive: intervocalic \textit{t} may have been weakened in Proto-Celtic, let us say, to a voiceless media (a lenis stop) from which both [θ] and [d] developed at a later date\footnote{I am unsure what Martinet means by ‘voiceless media (a lenis stop)’. The term ‘media’ is a dated synonym for a voiced stop consonant, yet the term is preceded by ‘voiceless’, its antonym.}.}{martinet_celtic_1952}{195}
These words demonstrate that Martinet is the first to posit lenited allophones of \gls{T} differing in length from unlenited allophones of \gls{D}, and which equalled neither its Goidelic reflexes /f θ x/ nor its ultimate Brittonic reflexes /b d g/. There is no evidence that Martinet believed these shared Goidelic-Brittonic lenis stops ever survived to be a phoneme in post-apocope Celtic.

He is able to posit length as constituting the difference between \xT\ and its allophone \lT\  because he connects lenition with gemination, which allowed for length distinction in the first place. Martinet argues that  the pressure of these geminated consonants causes the articulation of singletons to be relaxed. Subsequently, unweakened single consonants merged with geminates and not with their weakened counterparts~\autocite[212]{martinet_celtic_1952}. This reidentification gives insight into what differentiated  radical and lenited consonants. Geminates were pronounced long, so the radical consonants which came to be identified with geminates must have been long also compared to their lenited counterparts. Thus, the distinction between radical and lenited must originally have been one of length.


One way in which the reidentification of geminates with unlenited consonants played out was the merger of \lT\  with \xD. I argue that this merger occured much later word-initially than elsewhere. Martinet gives a convincing account of how and why this merger occurred in Romance languages and notes that his arguments are equally applicable to Brittonic. The explanation for this early merger lies in the rarity of voiced geminates in Brittonic as well as in Greek, Germanic, and Latin: 
\tqt{Geminated voiced stops [in Brittonic] probably existed, but hardly at other points than at morphemic junctures. The situation must have been very much like the one which prevailed in Latin, where the gemination of surds was common both at the juncture of morphemes (as in \textit{at-tingo, ap-pello}) and elsewhere (as in \textit{bucca, puppa, mitto}), whereas geminated voiced stops were most exceptional except at morpheme juncture (as in \textit{ag-ger, ab-brevio, red-do}). Even here there was a tendency to eliminate them as soon as the feeling for composition became blurred; cf.\ \textit{credō} as opposed to Skt.\ \textit{\c{c}rad-dadhāmi}, and later \textit{reddō > rendo} with dissimilation, probably suggested by \textit{pre(he)ndō}; cf.\ also Ital.\ \textit{argine} `dam levee' from \textit{agger} (once \textit{arger}). A very similar situation must have prevailed in classical Greek, where \textit{-ππ-, -ττ-, -κκ-, -πφ-, -τθ-, -κχ-} are frequent (both as the reflexes of normal sound shifts and in hypocoristic formation as a result of some expressive process) but where \textit{-ββ-, -δδ-, -γγ-} are so exceptional nothing prevented the use of \textit{-γγ-} for [ŋg]. A tendency to unvoice geminates must have existed in the older stages of Germanic, at least in cases of expressive gemination, as is shown for instance by the geminated surd of OE \textit{liccian}, OHG \textit{lecchōn}, as opposed to Goth.\ \textit{bilaigon} (with regular \textit{-g-} from *\textit{-\^gh-}; cf.\ Gk.\ \textit{λείχω}, OIr.\ \textit{ligim}, etc.).
}{martinet_celtic_1952}{198}
In short, voiced geminates in  positions other than word-initial were so rare that the functional value of a three-way stop distinction would have been minimal, so they merged with lenited voiceless stops. Hence, a word like \gpc{*ad-beros} > \pc{*abberos} > \gmw[estuary]{aber} was spelled as \mw{aper} in \gls{ow}, because the word would have merged with a hypothetical \gpc{**aperos} by this stage and because \gls{ow} would orthographically represent any sound existing in a lenited form using its radical counterpart\footnote{This point is confirmed in Section~\ref{bdgwithptc}}. Martinet argues that this merger may have occurred early, but it must have postdated the Brittonic-Goidelic split because voiced geminates and lenited voiceless stops have distinct reflexes in the Goidelic languages. Underlined phonemes in Table~\ref{tab:goidvoicedgems} show the differing reflexes of \lT\ and \xD\ non-word-initially in Old Irish, but not in Middle Welsh.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{lllll}

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}%
  \caption{Realisation of \lT\ and \xD\ word-medially in Old Irish and Middle Welsh.}
  \label{tab:goidvoicedgems}%
\end{table}%

The consequence of this development is that \lT\ and \xD\ were only distinguished in those environments where they both appeared with a somewhat comparable frequency: word-initially. There is no order-of-magnitude difference in the number of words starting with radical \mow[]{p, t, c} on the one hand and \mow[]{b, d, g} in the other found in a typical Welsh text. Martinet does not make this point himself, but it follows logically from his argument\footnote{He implies the opposite, \ie that word-initial \xD\ and \lT\ also merged, when he describes the evolution of Brittonic stops, he simply notes that `\textit{-p-, -t-, -k-} were voiced to \textit{-b-, -d-, -g-}' without mentioning the position of these consonants within a word~\autocite[198]{martinet_celtic_1952}.}.
% He does note, however, that `the phonemic stability of word initials was restored by the analogical extension of one and the same phoneme to all syntactic situations'~\autocite[212]{martinet_celtic_1952} in Western Romance. Thus he implies % what exactly?
Proposing that a merger only occurred non-word-initially requires a definition of `word', which is a non-trivial matter  discussed in Chapter~\ref{cha:some-phon-issu}. 

% \todo[inline]{If I had infinite space, I should also discuss gemination and spirantisation from the perspective of Greene, Jackson, Schrijver, Isaac, Sims-Williams and Thomas. I do not however, so I need to decide how to concisely summarise this discussion, if I mention it at all. There is no point in dropping their names without engaging with their argument in any form.}

\section{Experimental evidence from Breton}
\label{sec:falchun}
\Textcite{falchun_systeme_1951} is the first author to propose that word-initial \lT\ and \xD\ were indeed separate phonemes at some point in Brittonic. This insight comes from experimental evidence. He notes that word-initial lenited voiceless stops and unlenited voiced stops are kept separate by length in his own Breton dialect of Le Bourg Blanc.
\tqt{\begin{french}
    Elles [les occlusives sonores initiales] sont toujours fortes, à moins qu'elles no proviennent de la mutation de \textit{p, t, k}. Pour plus de clarté, nous les transcrirons par \textit{bb, dd, gg}, et réserverons les signes \textit{b, d, g} pour les occlusives intervocaliques, ou initiales résultant de la mutation \textit{p, t, k}.
  \end{french}
  \footnote{They [the initial voiced stops] are always strong, at least when they do not come from the mutation of \mob{p, t, k}. For extra clarity, we transcribe them with \mob{bb. dd. gg}, and reserve the signs \mob{b, d, g} for the intervocalic stops, or intial stops resulting from the mutation of \mob{p, t, k}.}}{falchun_systeme_1951}{63}
Using Falc'hun's notation, Breton has \mob{bb, dd, gg} for word-initial \xD, while word-medial and word-final \gls{D} as well as word-initial \lT are represented by \mob{b, d, g}. The effect of having different phonemes initial positions is that some minimal pairs may be discerned. He gives the following examples:
\begin{mwl}
  \langc[]{\cite[64]{falchun_systeme_1951}}{\mob{tôrrèd éó é gār; tôrrèd éó é ggār}\footnote{Note that this example is not technically a minimal pair, because the /r/ is long in \mob[car]{karr}, but short in \mob[leg]{gar}. However, this difference may be neutralised word-finally~\autocite[34]{carlyle_syllabic_1988}.}}{his car is broken; her leg is broken}
  \langc[]{\cite[64]{falchun_systeme_1951}}{\mob{trṓèd éó e dūr; trṓèd éó e ddūr}}{his tower is tilted; he has turned into water}
  \langc[]{\cite[64]{falchun_systeme_1951}}{\mob{kwḗzed éó é bāz; kwḗzed éó é bbāz}}{his cough has dropped; her stick has dropped}
\end{mwl}
% \tqt{\begin{french}
%   Prenons les deux suivantes, qui ont été expérimentées, avec bien d'autres du même genre, sur des auditoires bretonnants du Léon, du Tréguier ou de la Cornouaille:

%   1. \textit{(tôrrèd éó é g\={\c{a}}r)}; 2. \textit{(tôrrèd éó é gg\={\c{a}}r)}. Les bretonnants traduisent sans hésitation: 1. «Sa charette à lui est cassée», \textit{torret eo e garr.} 2. «Sa jambe à elle est cassée», \textit{torret eo he gar.}

The distinct pronunciation of these consonants has some limitations. Following a consonant, \xD\ and \lT\ merge, and the differentiation is not always historically grounded:
\tqt{
  \begin{french}
    Toutefois, la distinction n'est possible qu'après voyelle. Le \textit{d} initial de \textit{an dud}, «les gens», de \textit{tud} ne diffère rien de celui de \textit{an dour}, «l'eau».  
    Et si une occlusive sonore provenant de la mutation de \textit{p, t, k}, se trouve à l'initiale absolue, elle se prononce forte, ainsi le \textit{b} de \textit{breman}, «à présent», qui provient du \textit{p} de \textit{pred}, «moment».
    Le \textit{b} sera doux dans \textit{abred, (abr\c{ē}d)}, «de bonne heure», ais fort dans \textit{ha breman (a bbr\`{\c{ē}}mã)}, «et à présent», parce que \textit{ha}, réduction de \textit{hag}, n'adoucit pas la consonne suivante […].
  \end{french}\footnote{At any rate, the distinction is only possible following a vowel. The initial \mob{d} of \mob[the people]{an dud}, from \mob{tud} does not differ at all from that of \mob[the water]{an dour}. And if a voiced stop originating from the mutation of \mob{p, t, k} is found at absolute initial position, it is pronounced strongly, thus the \mob{b} in \mob[at present]{breman}, which comes from \mob{p} of \mob[moment]{pred}. The \mob{b} is soft in \mob[in time]{abred, (abr\c{ē}d)}, but strong in \mob[and at present]{ha breman (a bbr\`{\c{ē}}mã)}, because \mob{ha}, reduction of \mob{hag}, does not lenite the following consonant.}}{falchun_systeme_1951}{64} 
Falc'hun's examples involving \mob[moment]{pred} and its derived forms \mob[in time]{abred} and \mob[now]{bremañ}  are important in understanding the mechanics Breton differentiation between \xD\ and \lT\ on a synchronic level. Historically, \mob{bremañ} is the lenited form of \mob{pred} + \mob{mañ}, and it is always lenited because it always forms an adverbial clause. At some point, lenition was petrified, meaning  \mob{b} was reanalysed as the radical form. The fact that initial \xD\ and \lT\ are differentiated  allows us to confirm that \mob{bremañ} was indeed reanalysed as such. This reanalysis results in initial \xD\ and not \lT, which demonstrates that \lT\ is only differentiated from \xD\ as long as the speaker lays a connection with \xT. In other words, a Breton speaker only uses \lT\ if his vocabulary contains the same word beginning with \xT. Apparently, there is no such a word as \mob{**premañ}, and the connection with \mob[moment]{pred} is lost; therefore, the difference between \lT\ and \xD\ is only found as a feature of \gls{morphophonlen} and instances of \lT\ lenited as \gls{petr} are treated as \xD\footnote{ Section~\ref{sec:lenition} treats the differences between these types of lenition.}. The instance of \mob[in time]{abred} shows  that \lT\ and \xD\ are only differentiated word-initially and that reanalysis of word boundaries may cause the distinction between \lT\ and \xD\ to collapse\footnote{Section~\ref{sec:indet-word-separ} defines the term `word'.}.

The former situation would argue for Harvey's position that the opposition was analogically reintroduced, since using lenition exclusively to disambiguate echoes later grammatical innovations such as syntactic lenition more than it does inherited patterns. Falc'hun  implies this position in his quote two paragraphs below.

Leur hauteur explosive est toujours plus grande que celle de \textit{b, d, g}. \end{french}}{falchun_systeme_1951}{65}

% The above quote seems to imply a relationship between fortition and distinguishing unlenited voiced stops and lenited voiceless stops.
According to Falc'hun, the ability to distinguish lenited voiceless stops from unlenited voiced stops depends on the working of lenition as a morphophonemic system, which gives a synchronic explanation for why the distinction \lT\ and \xD\ only occurs word-initially:
\tqt{\begin{french}
    Cette opposition entre deux séries d'occlusives sonores, l'une forte et l'autre douce, ne joue dans la langue qu'un rôle négligeable. Son existence fait cependant mieux comprendre la logique du mécanisme des mutations tel qu'il sera décrit plus loin. 
    % Sans elle, dans un système consonantique où toute consonne est forte ou douce, on ne saurait où classer \textit{b, d, g,} qui sont des douces, puisque provenant de l'adoucissement de \textit{p, t, k,} et qui seraient en même temps des fortes, puisque s'adoucissant elles-mêmes en \textit{v, z, h}.
  \end{french}\footnote{
    This opposition between two series of voiced stops, one strong and the other weak, only plays a negligible role in the language. Its existence nevertheless allows for a better understanding of the logic of the mechanism of the mutations as it is described further on.}}{falchun_systeme_1951}{65}
He then notes that radical \mob{n-, l-, r-} are long consonants and that they are identical to medial long \mob{nn, ll, rr} following the accent, while lenited \mob{n-, l-, r-} are identical to short \mob{n, l, r} following the accent. These long and short sonorants are similarly phonemically distinct, so they form minimal pairs:
\begin{mwl}

\end{mwl}
Falc'hun thus produces evidence for a Brittonic dialect maintaining the distinction between word-initial \lT\ and \xD; however, he shows that this distintion is firmly embedded into the way lenition operates as a morphophonemic process synchronically. He also shows that this distinction of length between radical and lenited is not restricted to the stop system, because \mob{n, l, r} also employ length to distinguish between radical and lenited.

A further experimental study on Léonais Breton comes from~\textcite[27--28]{carlyle_syllabic_1988}, whose data on the dialect of Lanhouarneau confirm the existence of a length contrast in both resonants and stop consonants. She also confirms that the contrast is phonetically best described as a difference in duration. This contrast is similarly employed to distinguish between \lT\ and \xD.

\Textcite{carlyle_syllabic_1988} offers a series of assumptions and derivation rules by which this three-way distinction may be derived. She argues that word-medial fortis stops (\ie \gls{T}) are long while lenis stops (\ie \gls{D}) are short. The distinction in voice is secondarily supplied by a redundancy rule~\autocite[46]{carlyle_syllabic_1988}. Lenition  of voiceless stops and of resonants constitutes degemination; that is, shortening while lenition of \gls{D} is fricativisation. She argues that the same underlying structure is found word-initially: \gls{D} is secondarily voiced because it is short, while \gls{T}, which is long, is not. In word-initial position, moreover, a rule determines the  obstruents that  may be lengthened. This word-initial gemination is applied not only in absolute initial position, but also after an element which does not cause lenition. Word-initial gemination is not applied following lenition, however. These rules together allow for a phonological distinction of \lT\ and \xD, as is shown in Table~\ref{tab:carlylederiv}.

The result of the application of these synchronic rules is that word-medial \gls{D} is identified with word-initial \lT and word-initial \xD\ is a separate phoneme. This is expected under Martinet's account where word-medial \xD\ must have merged with \lT\ early on.

It should be noted that both Falc'hun's findings and Carlyle's model constitute only a synchronic description of their respective Breton dialects. They do not describe the extent to which three-way stop distinction was applicable to earlier stages of Brittonic. The observations given above are also far from universal even within present-day Breton, as Jackson observes for the dialect of Plougrescant:
\tqt{Since initial consonants are always short (lenis) there is no initial distinction of fortis-lenis, and therefore no system such as that described by Falc'hun for Le Bourg Blanc. He gives \textit{he bbaz} <<her stick>> and \textit{he ggar} <<her leg>>, from \textit{baz} and \textit{gar}, versus \textit{e baz} <<his cough>> and \textit{e garr} <<his cart>>, from \textit{paz} and \textit{karr} […]. % Similarly, \textit{an hini nneta, an hini llousa}, and \textit{an hini rruz} when masculine, but \textit{an hini neta, an hini lousa,} and \textit{an hini ruz} when feminine, and compare \textit{he lleur} <<her threshing-floor>> versus \textit{e leur} <<his threshing-floor>>, etc. […]

  % and there is no difference between \textit{an hini nevez, an hini lousañ,} and \textit{an hini ruz} whether masculine or feminine. [̣\dots]
  In Falc'hun's system the distinction must be phonemic, since it carries with it a distinction in meaning which the speakers recognise, but at Plougrescant there is certainly no difference and therefore no phonemic difference.}{Jac_Phonology61}{332}



\section{From Breton to Brittonic}
\label{sec:jackson}
Falc'hun's measurements of length distinctions between radical and lenited consonants in a present-day Brittonic dialect soon influenced the historical phonology of Brittonic. \Textcite[§~132]{jackson_language_1953} proposes a Common Celtic language with comparatively long consonants in absolute initial position, in internal geminates, and in certain consonant clusters. Comparitively short consonants were initially found after proclitics ending in vowels, or internally between vowels or in combination with some resonants. He describes the later development of this system in Brittonic as follows:
\tqt{What seems to have happened is that at a certain stage yet to be determined the Common Celtic short consonants, being mostly invervocal, underwent a loosening or weakening of articulation which resulted in the voiceless stops \textit{p , t, c} become voiced to \textit{b, d, g}; the voiced stops \textit{b, d, g} becoming the spirants \textit{ƀ, đ, ʒ} […] The long consonants, however, whether intervocal or in absolute initial, were energetic enough to resist this loosening and remained unaffected at first; though later and as a quite separate evolution \textit{-pp-, -tt-}, and \textit{-cc-} became \textit{f, th, ch}, and \textit{-bb-, -dd- -gg-} were simplified. The half-long consonants in initial position have lasted to the present day in Breton, being now fully long, but in Welsh they were subsequently shortened. So, for example, […] Brit.~*\textit{adbero-} > *\textit{abbero-} gave Welsh \& Breton \textit{aber}, ``river-mouth'', in which the geminate resisted lenition, but was later shortened and so fell together with \textit{b} the lenition of \textit{p}.
}{jackson_language_1953}{§~132}
From this we may gather that Jackson follows roughly this relative chronology of lenition for stop consonants:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Shortening  of intervocalic non-geminate consonants.
\item Voicing of shortened \pbr{p t k} to \pbr{b d g}; spirantisation of \pbr{b d g} to \pbr{β ð ɣ}.
\item Spirantisation of \pbr{pp tt kk} to \pbr{f th ch}; simplification, \ie shortening of \pbr{bb dd gg}.
\end{enumerate}
These steps preceded apocope according to~\textcite[§~133]{jackson_language_1953}.
% Although he is equipped with Falc'hun's experimental results, Jackson fails to see here what Martinet sees: the connection between the first and the last step, \ie between lenition and gemination.
Taken at face value, Jackson would have intervocalic non-geminate consonants shorten, but the shortening of intervocalic geminates would have to wait until after the Goidelic-Brittonic split so that the simplification of geminate \gls{D} can be considered simultaneously with spirantisation. The result of these developments was that Jackson envisages a three-way allophonic length distinction of voiceless stops before apocope and spirantisation occurred. For example, phoneme /t/ would have three realisations: in Jackson's notations these were [t] in intervocalic position, [T] in absolute initial position, and [TT] for intervocalic geminates and singletons following resonants\footnote{This full array of symbols is used in \textcite{Jac_Gemination60} and \textcite{Jac_Historical67}.}. The first of these would be lenited later and the third spirantised. Jackson needs such a three-way opposition  to account for the difference between initial stops remaining stops and geminates becoming spirants. 


Jackson's \emph{Language and History in Early Britain}~\autocite*{jackson_language_1953} primarily focuses on establishing the dates for sound changes. Jackson also attempts to do this with lenition, which makes it important to know his definition of lenition:
\tqt{What is meant, then, by the date of lenition is the time when e.g.~\textit{t} became a full \textit{d} in British and a full \textit{th} in Irish, and these were felt as phonemes distinct from non-lenited \textit{tt, t(t)-}.
}{jackson_language_1953}{§~132}
Apparently Jackson attempts to date the merger of \lT\ and \xD, because he talks about \pbr[]{t} becoming full \pbr[]{d}. Yet he also mentions the date when \lT\ and \xD\ were no longer distinct phonemes as being relevant. I take the second criterion to mean the moment when lenited and radical allophones were sufficiently different that they could be reinterpreted as separate phonemes rather than radical and lenited actually being separate phonemes. This is because when he sets out the evidence for his date, the first thing he notes is:
\tqt{The chief certain fact about the \textit{relative} dating of lenition in Brittonic is that it must be older than the loss of final syllables, since otherwise consonants which came to stand at the ends of words by that loss would no longer be intervocal.}{jackson_language_1953}{§~133}
Therefore, apocope is what made word-initial lenited consonants phonemic in the first place. Apparently, Jackson equates  \lT\ as different from \xT\ and  \lT\ merging with \xD. Yet there is no reason why only a merger of \lT/\xD\ would be able to bring about a phonemic distinction between \xT\ and \lT.

Indeed Falc'hun has shown how three different series of consonants may stand in a three-way distinction following apocope. One way to make sense of Jackson's choice to define lenition as the merger of \lT\ and \xD\  is to assess the evidence he uses for his date of lenition. His evidence comprises loanwords from Brittonic and British Latin into Goidelic, inscriptions, personal names, and place-names~\autocite[§§~133–134]{jackson_language_1953}. His evidence always consists of single words rather than whole sentences. This type of evidence cannot shed light on the precise effect of the morphophonemic process of lenition on initial consonants at any given moment, because \gls{morphophonlen} is only ever found in the interface of several words. The only thing that can be established from this evidence is the point at which \lT\ and \xD\ merged word-medially and word-finally. \Textcite[§~142]{jackson_language_1953} concludes that `the Late British lenition of \textit{p, t, c, b, d, g, m} to \textit{b, d, g, ƀ, đ, ʒ, μ} took place in the second half of the fifth century'\todo{pa mor dda ydy dyddiad Jackson yn cadw lan heddiw?}. Given the nature of his evidence, I assume that his date  refers only to the non-initial merger of \lT\ with \xD\footnote{The date could also refer to when the remaining lenited consonants became spirants, but this is unlikely to be this late, as this development is shared with Goidelic.}. For the word-initial merger of \lT\ with \xD, \textcite{jackson_language_1953} does not give evidence one way or another. In the absenceevidence that word-initial \lT\ was distinct from \xD,  the word-initial merger could just as well have occurred at the same moment as elsewhere. Yet there is no such absence of evidence.  \Textcite{martinet_celtic_1952} demonstrates how non-lenited voiced stops in other positions than word-initial were exceedingly rare, while they were reasonably common word-initially. At the same time, \textcite{falchun_systeme_1951} gave insight into the way in which a word-initial contrast between \xD\ and \lT\ can work synchronically. 


Following \textcite{martinet_celtic_1952}, \textcite{greene_gemination_1956} notes that Jackson fails to see that geminates can only be long in opposition to the shortness of non-geminates. It is, therefore, nonsense to speak of the simplification of voiced geminates centuries after non-geminates were shortened intervocalically. \Textcite{Gre_Spirant66} notes that it is impossible to envisage a threefold quantitative distinction  and that Jackson's [TT] and [T] must be considered a single length grade. The  reflexes of Jackson's [TT, T] as both voiceless spirants and voiceless stops, respectively, occur because the sound law turning non-lenited voiceless stops into spirants  only applied to a subset of these stops, resulting in a situation where spirantisation is, `in its origins, only a special case of non-lenition'~\autocite[119]{Gre_Spirant66}. Greene puts spirantisation following apocope, and the Brittonic phonemes descending from stops immediately after apocope are: short voiced stops representing \lT, long voiced stops representing \xD, and voiceless stops representing \xT. Thus in Greene's conception, \lT\ and \xD\ differed from one another in length, and \xT\ differed from the other stops in voice, but \xT\ was unmarked for length because short voiceless stops had become voiced stops earlier. Greene does not specify why these lenited voiceless stops became voiced earlier. He simply takes this voicing for granted because this is what occurs in present-day Brittonic dialects\footnote{These assumptions are not defended because the topic of disagreement between Jackson and Greene was not the historical phonology of lenition, but of spirantisation.}.


The debate between Jackson and Greene is reconsidered by \textcite{harvey_aspects_1984}. He joins Greene in rejecting Jackson's three-way length distinction and notes that Jackson's account attempts to give information about several periods at once rather than reflecting an opposition at any given time. Harvey then traces how consonants in different environments go through various successive stages, and establishes which features were actually contrastive in each of these stages. He uses the dental phonemes as an example.

Harvey's first stage is what he calls `prelenition Celtic', by which he means the stage during which lenition was allophonic, the lenited allophones were shorter than their radical counterparts,  and these short allophones could later supply their Goidelic as well as their Brittonic descendants. So what Harvey means by `lenition' is the fricativisation of phonetically lenited consonants in Goidelic, and the voicing, shortening, and fricativisation of these consonants in Brittonic. He notes that during this stage double consonants only occur in strictly internal, intervocalic positions. He then follows Martinet in positing that any consonant not in leniting position would merge with these double consonants phonetically. This stage is represented in Table~\ref{tab:harveypreap}.

\end{table}%
Harvey proposes this phonetic arrangement  because it matches the Goidelic reflexes. Harvey notes that intervocalic non-geminate stops became fricatives in Goidelic, giving the result shown in Table~\ref{tab:harveygoid}\footnote{Harvey silently assumes that fricativisation of lenited consonants preceded apocope. This is not \lat{a priori} necessary but likely to be true because it is shared between Goidelic and Brittonic.}.

  \label{tab:harveygoid}%
\end{table}%

After Goidelic lenited stops became fricatives, length no longer served to make phonemic distinctions, so an unlenited /t/ had the same length irrespectively of whether /t/ was historically a geminate /-tt-/, absolute initial /\#t-/, or following a resonant /-Rt-/, because they all appeared in different contexts. This arrangement confirms that phonetic lenition entailed the identification of intervocalic non-geminate stops as short. Geminate stops remained long and remaining consonants that were not specified for length came to be identified with the geminates. This distinction was originally one of length, which can be internally reconstructed because lenition entailed the identification of unlenited stops with long geminates; however Harvey also finds further evidence for this in Goidelic. Non-lenited stops are pronounced long in a number of present-day Goidelic dialects; this length is not phonemic synchronically, but may be diachronically connected with geminates. The opposition between lenited and unlenited resonants is largely one of length in multiple branches of Celtic. Also, Latin loanwords into Irish consistently show that the Classical Latin opposition geminate/single is adopted as unlenited/lenited. This means that any consonant that would have been a geminate consonant cluster in Classical Latin would be loaned into Goidelic as a single unlenited consonant, and any intervocalic single consonant in Classical Latin would be loaned as a lenited consonant into Goidelic.

For Brittonic, Harvey asserts that  lenition  occurred before apocope. That is: short stops in intervocalic position lost distinctive length and former voiceless stops became voiced stops, while former voiced stops became fricatives. As a result, geminate voiced stops in words such as \mw[estuary]{aber} fell together with lenited voiceless stops. This merger between word-medial \xD\ and \lT\ is indicated with arrows in Table~\ref{sfig:harveybrit1}. Harvey argues that this merger is borne out by the later evidence:
\tqt{It is no longer possible, from synchronic considerations, to tell whether a given internal intervocalic voiced stop (\textit{g, b, d}) is the product of the lenition of an unvoiced simplex (/k, p, t/) or of the non-lenition of a voiced genimate (/gg, bb, dd/); hence the disagreement about whether Welsh, Cornish, and Breton \textit{ober} `work' derives from Latin \textit{opera} or from a native /obber-/ < /od+ber-/.}{harvey_aspects_1984}{96}
The later evidence does show that word-medial \xD\ and \lT\ merged, but it does not identify when this merger occurred or indeed whether this merger occurred before apocope, as Harvey suggests.

It follows logically from Harvey's assertions that apocope would lead to the same merger between \lT\ and \xD\ word-initially. This merger is indicated with arrows in Table~\ref{sfig:harveybrit2}\footnote{Harvey then describes how a subset of the \pbr{t}'s in Table~\ref{sfig:harveybrit2} would  undergo spirantisation, but this step is irrelevant here.}. This is indeed what Harvey argues:
\tqt{This treatment also destroys the distinction between the relevant elements of examples [/V+\textit{d}\"{u}ːd/] and [/V+\textit{d}uβr/], since if gemination has indeed disappeared, the lenition of an unvoiced stop gives the same phoneme as the non-lenition of the corresponding voiced one and both are now in identical environments in initial sandhi. But once again, we find that this prediction is generally borne out in practice: thus in Welsh `his stags' (\textit{ceirw}, plural of \textit{carw}) and `her waves' (\textit{geirw}) are indistinguishably \textit{ei geirw}.}{harvey_aspects_1984}{96--97}

He argues that only Breton provides counter-evidence, but he gives three arguments why the dissimilarity in Breton \lT\ and \xD\ is not inherited. The first is that word-initial distinction between \lT\ and \xD\ is only attested in Le Bourg Blanc Breton\footnote{\Textcite{carlyle_syllabic_1988} finds it in Lanhouarneau also, but her thesis came out after \textcite{harvey_aspects_1984}.} and in none of the other modern Celtic languages, but linguistic reconstruction does not work by simple head counting: archaic features may well be preserved in only a minority of dialects. His second argument is that distinct \lT\ and \xD\ are only found word-initially, but not word-medially. Yet Martinet already identified word-medial voiced geminates as exceedingly rare compared to non-lenited voiced stops.

The third argument is that the resonants in Le Bourg Blanc Breton provide a solid analogical base. This argument holds more water. Harvey notes that the resonants \mob{n, l ,r} can be both long and short word-initially. Thus, length is the only feature keeping radical and lenited resonants apart word-initially, so length in stops may not be original, but the outcome of the analogical extension of the system:
\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{l@{~=~}l}
    \textsc{radical}  & [+gemination]\\
    \textsc{lenition} & [-gemination]
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}
from resonants to stops~\autocite{harvey_aspects_1984}. In terms of  \textcite{carlyle_syllabic_1988}, this analogical extension may be formulated as the spread of word-initial gemination from resonants to stops (Table~\ref{tab:carlylederiv}). All the other rules formulated by Carlyle are in agreement with Harvey.

Harvey's proposed analogy easily explains the Breton evidence, but his account can easily be modified to bypass the need for  analogy in the first place. For Common Celtic pre-phonemic lenition, Harvey argues in detail that the original distinction between radical and lenited stops was one of length. Then, when he discusses Brittonic, he does away with length distinctions for stops altogether and posits that length was wholly replaced by voice prior to apocope. Then, accounting for the Breton evidence, he posits that they were analogically reintroduced. Yet it would be simpler to conceive of a simplified chronology where the loss of length did not occur at any time between Proto-Brittonic and Le Bourg Blanc Breton in the first place. This simplification would be that the voicing of lenited voiceless stops does not necessarily equal the loss of distinctive length of stop consonants. Then later, this word-initial length distinction was lost at some point in Welsh and in the Breton dialects where a distinction between \lT\ and \xD\ was not maintained.

In conclusion, the arguments between Jackson, Greene and Harvey resulted in the view that length may be identified as the original variable distinguishing pre-apocope radical and lenited stops. These distinctions could then phonemicise with the loss of final syllables. Greene demonstrated that length distinctions were \emph{only} used for distinguishing between fortis and lenis consonants. Based on this insight, length could be considered a feature marking lenition across \gls{archphon}s following apocope\footnote{\Gls{archphon}s are groups of radical and mutated phonemes sharing a single radical phoneme, and they are further discussed in Subsection~\ref{sec:from-allit-text}.}. Here, short length marked lenited and long length marked radical phonemes. Yet all three scholars assume that this length distinction was replaced or at least supplemented by a voicing distinction early on in pre-apocope Brittonic. For stops, Harvey even posits a wholesale replacement of length with voicing for stops. In other words, they understand that the only use of length was to distinguish between what was to become radical and lenited consonants, but they cannot conceive that length could be the sufficient as a variable in distinguishing radical from lenited consonants stops in post-apocope Brittonic. Because of this, they all place the merger of \lT\ with \xD\ prior to apocope.

Yet there is evidence to the contrary. \Textcite{carlyle_syllabic_1988} finds that the voicing of \lT\ should be described as a derived feature from length; not vice versa. If we compare the three word-initial stop series of Le Bourg Blanc (and Lanhouarneau) Breton with Harvey's reconstruction of Common Celtic allophones, then it is found that two regular developments suffice in describing the differences. These rules are apocope, which phonemicises the Common Celtic length distinctions, and a redundant rule which voices short \ie lenited consonants is all that is needed. This rule must be placed following apocope. This model is illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:pctolbbbstops}.

The model given in Figure~\ref{fig:pctolbbbstops} may easily be adapted to \gls{mow} and the dialects of \gls{mob} that do not distinguish \lT\ from \xD. These dialects may be derived from this model by positing that distinctive length was lost following the voicing of \lT. Under this model, the voicing of \lT\ would occur after apocope in all Brittonic dialects.


\section{From Brittonic to Welsh}
\label{sec:from-brittonic-welsh}
The first scholar to critique the unspoken assumption that Brittonic lenition must entail the voicing of voiceless stops prior to apocope is \textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990}. Instead he posits an Old Celtic lenition where the initially allophonic opposition between radical and lenited was one of aspiration and of voice.  In his conception, \xT\ was voiceless aspirated, \lT\ was voiceless and unaspirated, and \xD\ was voiced. This system is identical to the proposals by Pedersen and Thurneysen shown in Table~\ref{tab:pedersenstops}\footnote{\Textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990} uses a slightly different notation for \lT: [b̥ d̥ ɡ̥]. In \gls{ipa} notation, a circle below is used to indicate devoicing, so these symbols may be considered equivalent to [p t k]. The circled forms may also be used to indicate half-voiced. \Textcite[§~29]{koch_*cothairche_1990} leaves open such a possibility due to the conflicting evidence of loanwords into Old English, where Brittonic forms are found as both voiced and voiceless stops.}.

According to \textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990} archaic Brittonic names and phrases borrowed into Irish such as \oi{Coirthech}, which was to survive into Welsh as \mow{Ceredig}, were introduced into Irish at a time when all \gls{pc} stops had fortis and lenis allophones. These lenis allophones must have had such a pronunciation that they could be interpreted as Irish lenited consonants, so that they could later become spirantised when lenited voiceless stops became voiceless spirants in Goidelic. This Goidelic spirantisation of lenited voiceless stops occurred in the mid to later fifth century. Thus Brittonic had a voiceless but lenis pronunciation of word-medial \lT\ at least up until the fifth century.

A number of Brittonic personal names and place names have been borrowed into Old English as well. Old English personal names such as \textit{Dinoot, Madoc, Cerdic} imply that final \lT\ was voiceless, but medial \lT\ was voiced; voiced word-initial \xD\ was correctly identified as voiced. Place names borrowed into Old English, however, show that \lT\ could also be interpreted as voiceless word-medially.

Koch thus regards the voicing of \lT\ to be a process which ocurred substantially later than apocope. Because it is apocope which causes the phonemicisation of lenition, it follows logically that \lT\ existed not only as allophones separate from \xD, but also as separate phonemes. He gives some clues as to how long this situation may have persisted. One clue is that the orthography of nin-century \gls{ow} and \gls{ob} consistently spell \lT\ with \ow{p, t, c}, which makes it unlikely that they had fallen together with initial \xD\footnote{In Chapter~\ref{oldwelsh}, I demonstrate that this is correct. Word-initial \lT\ is kept distinct from \xD, and the phoneme resulting from the non-word-initial merger of \lT\ and \xD\ was spelled in analogy with the word-initial phonemes.}. Koch argues that the later Welsh cynghanedd demonstrates that the latest date at which \lT\ may have merged with \xD\ must be the fourteenth century. In some Breton dialects, 

Koch also argues convincingly for the existence of aspiration as a variable in early Celtic. He notes that absolute initial voiceless stops are aspirated in all Celtic languages, and that this is old. This is suggestions by early confusions where a liquid robs the stop of its aspiration. This may lead to aspirated stops being reinterpreted as unaspirated. Examples of this sort are  \gpc[sword]{*kladjos} loaned as \glat{gladius}, the doublet \pc{Pretani} vs.~\pc{Bretanni}, and \lat{mons Graupius} for earlier \lat{Craupius}.

Koch gives convincing evidence that absolute word-initial \xT\ was aspirated, and that non-word-initial \lT\ was not voiced, but did have a lenis quality  somehow. This raises the question what this lenis quality was. Here, Koch asserts that lack of aspiration denoted the lenis quality of \lT. That is, \lT\ could be distinguished from \xT\ because it was unaspirated. He gives no positive arguments for this lack of aspiration, and argues against length instead. Koch rejects the view shared between Jackson, Greene and Harvey, \ie that the original distinction between radical and lenited was one of length\footnote{The point of disagreement between Jackson on one hand and Greene and Harvey on another is not so much on whether a system of long and short allophones existed for radical and lenited consonants, but on how many length grades there were.}. Instead in Koch's view, the \gls{mob} system where length serves to distinguish \lT\ from \xD\ is an innovation. This innovation is in turn explained by the fact that Breton has moved in the direction of voicing historically voiceless sounds, and no longer aspirating historically aspirated sounds. He also notes that distinctive stop length is typologically rare in absolute initial position. 

In Koch's model, early Brittonic \xT\ was voiceless aspirated, \lT\ plain voiceless, and \xD\ was voiced. In \gls{mob}, \xT\ is voiceless and long, \lT\ is voiced and short, and \xD\ is voiced and long. When Koch notes that Breton has moved in the direction of voicing, he means that aspirating consonants have become voiceless, and voiceless consonants have become voiced. Starting at Koch's reconstruction, Breton moving in the direction of voicing would yield voiceless \xT, voiced \lT, and voiced \xD\todo{I should refer to a chapter/section on voicing and aspiration here}. Thus we would expect a merger between \lT\ and \xD\ in Breton, yet it is Breton  of all Brittonic dialects which still distinguishes \lT/\xD. Koch argues that length would then be introduced to prevent this merger, but he gives no mechanism by which loss of aspiration in Breton would lead to the adoption of length. But even if Koch had given a convincing mechanism by which length could arise from loss of aspiration, then his argument would still hinge on the loss of aspiration in Breton, but this loss is not a clear-cut matter. Many Breton dialects use voicing rather than aspiration to distinguish voiced from voiceless~\autocite[221]{Ios_Representation13}. \Textcite[114]{Bot_Etude82} finds only voicing contrast in Argol Breton and \textcite[177--178]{Hum_Phonologie95a} explicitly denies that aspiration may be present in Bothoa.  \Textcite[9]{carlyle_syllabic_1988} finds that the degree of voicing may vary from speaker to speaker in Lanhouarneau. \Textcite[157--167]{falchun_systeme_1951} finds at least some aspiration in  Léon Breton. \Textcite{Ter_Grammaire70} finds traces of aspiration in Vannetais. Here it may be observed that those dialects keeping \lT\ and \xD\ distinct have at least some trace of aspiration.

Moreover, the idea that length served to distinguish radical from lenited consonants is not based exclusively on Le Bourg Blanc Breton. It also follows from Martinet's arguments discussed in Section~\ref{sec:martinet}. So, in order to reject length as the variable distinguishing radical from lenited consonants, one would need to face these arguments as well. 

Koch's argument that absolute intial stop length is typologically rare does not hold either, because it loses sight of the contexts in which length may serve to distinguish \lT\ from \xD\ in Léon Breton. In Le Bourg Blanc, a phrase-initial constituent may never be lenited. That is, if \lT\ appears at the beginning of a phrase, it is reinterpreted as \xD. Falc'hun already noted that historical /\gls{l}p/ in \mob{bremañ} is in fact pronounced with initial /\gls{x}b/\footnote{See Seciton~\ref{sec:falchun}.}. Thus, distinctive stop length serves to distinguish \lT\ from \xD\ in word-initial position, but not in phrase-initial position. But even setting aside this consideration, the argument that we must avoid positing typologically rare configurations should apply only when it is done out of thin air, but in this case we do see distinctive length in an actual related dialect. 

The following points summarise our knowledge of post-apocope Welsh based on the contribution made by \textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990} and my discussion thereof:
\begin{itemize}
\item Absolute initial \gls{T} was strongly aspirated in all ancient and early medieval Celtic languages.
\item \lT\ was phonetically voiceless, and could be interpreted by Goidelic speakers as equivalent to Goidelic \lT.
\item Initial \lT\ was distinct from \xD\ in \gls{ow} word-initially, and merged before the fourteenth century.
\item Koch's rejection of  length indicating the contrast between radical and lenited stops cannot be sustained.
\end{itemize}
The consequence of these points is that it is necessary to maintain a system where lenited stops were pronounced shorter than their radical counterparts, but with aspiration worked into it as a variable.

One way to do so is to simply add aspiration as a variable. This is done by \textcite{schrijver_old_2011}. In his overview of Old British phonology, he posits the system shown in Table~\ref{oldbritishconsonantsystem} for late Old British, meaning Old Welsh, Old Breton and Old Cornish. \Textcite[31]{schrijver_old_2011} does not defend this system in detail, because it is written in a handbook giving the state of the art in our knowledge of Brittonic languages and not as an article laying out the case for a particular system.

  \label{oldbritishconsonantsystem}
\end{table}

\Textcite{schrijver_old_2011} does not explicitly specify \lT\ for voice in \tref{oldbritishconsonantsystem}, but he does  specify \xD\ as voiced in the accompanying text:
\tqt{As a result of phonemic lenition, \textit{*p, *t, *k} became voiced short \textit{*b, *d, *g}. These were constrasted with the reflexes of the unlenited voiced stps, which were now phonemically long (and, persumably, tense), merging with the rare old geminate voiced stops: \textit{*bː, *dː, *gː}. In word-initial position, the contrast between short and long voiced stops is maintained […] in MoB dialects. % The unlenited voiceless stops were undoubtedly long too, \textit{*pː, *tː, *kː}, but they did not contrast with short voiceless stops. MoW evidence shows that these were probably strongly aspirated […].
}{schrijver_old_2011}{31}
What he lays out here is the stop system of Léon Breton with aspiration added as a variable to \xT. This reconstruction is not tenable because it ignores \textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990} discussed above, who notes that \lT\ cannot have been voiced in Old British. One way to fix Schrijver's system is by positing that \lT\ was initially voiceless instead of voiced. This is unproblematic, because the distinguishing feature of \lT\ from \xT\ and \xD\ is accepted to have been length anyway, so it does not cause any mergers. This would yield the system presented in Table~\ref{oldbritishconsonantsystem2}

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{lll}
    \toprule
    \xT & \xD & \lT \\\midrule

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Modification of Schrijver's Old British stop system where \lT\ is voiceless.}
  \label{oldbritishconsonantsystem2}
\end{table}

Yet Table~\ref{oldbritishconsonantsystem2} is not tenable either. If we set \lT\ aside, then \xT\ and \xD\ are redundantly specified: \xT\ is both voiceless and aspirated, while \xD\ is both voiced and unaspirated. Specification for either voice or aspiration would be sufficient in distinguishing these series. \Textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990} gives positive evidence for the existence of aspiration in Old British, so aspiration must have been the variable distinguishing \xT\ from \xD\ word-initially, as it still does in \gls{mow}\todo{Reference to a work on MoW phonetics.}. There is no comparable evidence that \xD\ was voiced in Old British; if it was, then voicing must have been a derived feature from non-aspiration. Adding \lT\ back into the mix, we must choose whether or not \lT\ was aspirated.

In my view, initial \lT\ must have been aspirated, because the alternative of a plain voiceless \lT\ would entail a development where \lT\ was only distinct from \xD\ in length; not in aspiration. Such a hypothetical development would have to be considered `voicing', even if the phonetic outcome of this development might be a voiceless stop. Such voicing cannot have occurred prior to the early stratum of Brittonic loanwords into Goidelic and Old English described by \textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990}.

\section{Voice and aspiration}
\label{sec:voice-aspiration}
To explain how voicing could lead to a plain voiceless stop, it is necessary to examine what it means for a consonant to be aspirated, voiceless or voiced. The difference between an aspirated voiceless stop, an unaspirated voiceless stop, and a voiced stop may be considered a single dimension; not two-dimensions where the features [aspiration] and [length] are independent and either may be turned off or on independently. Rather, aspirated stops, voiceless stops, and voiced stops may be regarded as different realisations a single variable, which is called \gls{vot}~\autocite{LA_CrossLanguage64}. Phonetically, \gls{vot} is the time that passes between the moment a stop consonant is released and the moment when voicing starts. Voicing is produced by the vibration of the vocal cords. The dimension of \gls{vot} is independent of the dimension of length. Stop length is the duration of the occlusion. 

When a voiced stop is produced, the \gls{vot} is negative, meaning that the vocal cords are already vibrating when the occlusion is released. The production of a simple voiceless stop constitutes a stop whose \gls{vot} is about zero, which means that the vibration of vocal cords starts at or near the release of the occlusion. When an aspirated stop is produced, \gls{vot} is positive, which means that there is a noticable delay between the opening of the occlusion and the moment the vocal cords start vibrating. Figure~\ref{fig:vvadiagram} illustrates the difference between the three.

Some languages, such as Thai, contain three distinct series of phonemes on different points of the \gls{vot} continuum. It is thus not typologically impossible to have a phonemic ternary contrast of \gls{vot} in Brittonic, but this is unlikely due to the evidence attesting to length as a variable. Given the existence of phonemic length, a two-way phonemic contrast of \gls{vot} is sufficient for immediate post-apocope Brittonic.

\section{My reconstruction}
\label{sec:my-reconstruction}



Based on the form of early Brittonic loanwords into Goidelic of the \oi{Coirthech}-type, \textcite{koch_*cothairche_1990} finds that \lT\ cannot have been voiced any more than \xT\ in immediate post-apocope Brittonic. This may be understood to mean that \gls{vot} cannot have been lower for \lT\ than \xT, and we know that \xT\ was aspirated, then it must follow that \lT\ was also aspirated. On the basis of this line of reasoning, I propose the stop system in Table~\ref{oldbritishconsonantsystemmine} for immediate post-apocope Brittonic.

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}[b]{0.5\linewidth}

  \label{oldbritishconsonantsystemmine}
\end{table}


Table~\ref{oldbritishconsonantsystemmine} presents my envisaged system in two notations. Table~\ref{tab:concrobcmine} contains the more concrete phonetic notation, where the \gls{ipa} symbols are used more literally, so \graph{p, t, k} represent any consonant where the \gls{vot} is zero or more; \graph{ʰ} represents aspirated stops, meaning positive or delayed \gls{vot}. There are no phonetically voiced stops, so \graph{b, d, ɡ} are not used. Table~\ref{tab:absobcmine} may represent the same system, but gives a more abstract phonemic notation. Here, \graph{p, t, k} are used where \gls{vot} is comparatively delayed, and \graph{b, d, ɡ} are used where \gls{vot} is comparatively advanced. Thus the symbols gain meaning in comparison with each other, just like how the values for \gls{vot} gain meaning in comparison with each other in spoken languages. Phonemic transcriptions in this thesis follow the convention laid out in Table~\ref{tab:absobcmine}.


\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview-1}

Above I argued how a critical review of earlier scholarsship on lenition allows one to posit a three-way stop opposition between \xT, \xD, and \lT\ in post-apocope Brittonic where aspiration and length served to distinguish these series. The following chapters will serve to confirm the existence of this system in Old and early Middle Welsh. These confirmations also give a more absolute chronology than what may be inferred from the above.

Chapter~\ref{oldwelsh} considers the orthography of stops in \gls{ow}. In \gls{ow}, lenition is generally not written, either word-initially or word-internally. Thus, \lT\ is regularly written with \ow{p, t, c}, just like \xT; \lD\ and \xD\ are regularly written with \ow{b, d, g}. This orthography is generally consistent, but there is a handful of instances where \gls{D} is written \ow{p, t, c} and \gls{T} is written with \ow{b, d, g}. The former category comprises all \gls{ow} words containing an etymologically word-internal \xD. Their orthography with \ow{p, t, c} demonstrates that the rare class of word-internal voiced geminates indeed merged with \lT\ as early as the \gls{ow} period. The latter category comprises the minority of words containing word-internal \lT\ spelled with \ow{b, d, g}. Chapter~\ref{oldwelsh} argues that these spellings imply that word-initial \lT\ was distinguished from initial \xD\ by means of aspiration: \lT\ was aspirated and \xD\ was not.

Chapter~\ref{cha:prov-mwbe-y} analyses sandhi patterns of stops in the Poetry of the Princes who were active in the from roughly the eleventh century until the thirteenth century. The sandhi patterns may be studied through the cynghanedd, the system of alliteration in poetry which is still in use today. The present-day cynghanedd  contains some provection rules. Within these rules, the pronunciation of a consonant may change depending on the preceding consonant, and may as a result alliterate with another consonant than itself. Chapter~\ref{cha:prov-mwbe-y} compares how these modern rules differ from the rules of the Poets of the Princes. It finds some differences between the two periods, and proposes a stop phonology within which the earlier rules may be understood. This stop phonology posits both length and aspiration as variables in distinguishing \xT, \lT, and \xD.

  %%% A Section on phonological length in MW???
  % Harvey bases his argument that analogy drove the distinction between \lT\ and \xD\ on the sonorants \mw{r, l, }and \mw{n}. These consonants have two phonemes each: a long fortis, and a short lenis. Naturally then, it is length that distinguishes fortis from lenis here. This identification of length as a marker for fortis quality was then expanded to voiced stops. This matter is of relevance to Welsh, precisely because Welsh does not use length to distinguish fortis and lenis consonants for \mw{r} and \mw{l}. Rather, voice is the common factor in distinguishing \graph{rh} and \graph{r}, and \graph{ll} and \graph{l}, respectively, while \graph{n} does not distinguish between fortis and lenis word-initially\footnote{\gls{mw} does distinguish /nː/, /rː/, and /lː/ from their short counterparts. This distinction is lost before the end of the Middle Welsh period, see also: \textcite[127--128]{schumacher_mittel-_2011}. The relevance of this phonemic opposition for the opposition between lenited voiceless stops and unlenited voiced stops is doubtful, however, because sonorants only use length to distinguish fortis and lenis in non-initial position, whereas it is precisely in word-initial position that lenited voiceless stops and unlenited voiced stops are kept separate in the Early \gls{mw} orthography and in Le Bourg Blanc Breton.}. Resonants  \graph{ll} /ɬ/ and \graph{l} /l/ also differ in manner of articulation: the former sound is a lateral fricative while the latter is a lateral approximant. %% this point is true, but it does not fit here. it talks about the MW situation specifically, so it is more suitable for the conclusion

\section{Phonetics and phonology of lenition in present-day Welsh} 
Unlike Breton, present-day Welsh does not preserve a three-way stop distinction either word-initially or elsewhere. Nevertheless, the way in which the contrast between voiced and voiceless stops is realised phonetically differs between dialects. In some Southeastern dialects of Welsh, the consonants themselves have phonetically merged, but they are kept separate by the length of neighboring vowels: e.g.\ \mw{ebol} /'eːpol/ `foal' v.s. \mw{capel} /'kapel/ `chapel'~\autocite[85]{awbery_phonotactic_1984}. One may wonder whether preceding vowel length similarly played a role in disambiguating the three Early Middle Welsh stop series as it does in disambiguating the two stop series remaining in Modern SE Welsh, and perhaps the modified survival of such a pattern in southeastern Welsh implies that this system survived for longer in these dialects. However, the idea that preceding vowel length may have served to disambiguate lenited voiceless stops from unlenited voiced stops has one drawback: the distinction between three different stop series was only maintained word-initially. The vowel lengthening would therefore have occurred in the word preceding the word to be lenited. The phonetic upshot of this would be (to use Koch's examples~\autocite*[§~26]{koch_*cothairche_1990}): [\c{e}ː g(ː)ar] `her leg' vs. [\c{e} gar] `his car'. This supposition is problematic, because only stressed syllables distinguish between short and long vowels, and the posessive pronouns in the above examples are both unstressed.
