\chapter{The stemmatics of \mw{Buchedd Dewi}}
\label{cha:stemm-mwbuch-dewi}
The Welsh life of Saint David, known in Welsh as \mw{Buchedd Dewi} survives in several manuscripts from the fourteenth century onwards. 

Brynley Roberts states that the Latin \lat{Vita Davidis}, a late eleventh-century composition, was translated only in the late thirteenth century. He does not discuss at length why he dates the translation to this period, but he notes that the Welsh version derived from a later edition and omits certain practices and doctrinal elements~\autocite[218--219]{Rob_Ystoriaeu11}. \Textcite[lviii]{Eva_Welsh88}, however, dates the first Welsh translation to the early fourteenth century rather than the late thirteenth century.

I argue that the dating of this common exemplar may be done on linguistic grounds using my methodology of counting occurrences of lenition of voiceless stops. I also argue that statistical analysis of the orthography of voiceless stops may help in understanding the transmission and the stemmatics of thirteenth-century texts into the fourteenth century and beyond.



\section{The database}
\label{sec:database}

The database containing instances of lenition used here differs from that in the previous chapters. Here, only lenition of \mw[]{p, t, c} is counted, and research exceptions are not included or discussed even as research exceptions. Instances of free lenition, such as object lenition or adverbial phrase lenition, are only included if lenition is written for at least one mansucript.


More significantly, one entry does not consist of an instance where we would expect lenition in one manuscript text, but rather one instance in three manuscript texts, \gls{j119}, \gls{ll27}, and \gls{ctd22}. In this manner, it is possible to compare not only to what degree each manuscript represents lenition, but also which specific instances of lenition agree or disagree with one another between manuscripts. This way, it is possible to find out whether orthographical lenition was added in a common ancestral manuscript, or independently. Table~\ref{tab:samplebuchedddewi} provides a sample from the beginning of the database. Words are given in \gls{mow} orthography, because the exact spelling of these words may vary between manuscripts. The database contains 213 data points in total.

\section{The manuscripts}
\label{sec:manuscripts-1}

The various manuscript in which \mw[]{Buchedd Dewi} survives are described by \textcite[lv--lviii]{Eva_Welsh88}. He notes that the text is extant in some fourteen manuscripts, and describes five of these. I have taken three of those five for analysis in this chapter.

\Acrlong{j119}, also called the Book of the Anchorite of Llanddewi Brefi dates to the mid-fourteenth century~\autocite{Tho_TEI13}. The manuscript's first text has a note in its preface. In this note, we find the manuscript was compiled for Gruffudd ap Llywelyn, who lived in northern Carmarthenshire. The note also contains a year, 1346, although it is quite certain to what it refers exactly. It might only have referred to when the first text was copied, and other texts may have been added later~\autocite[lvi--lvii]{Eva_Welsh88}.

\Acrlong{ll27}, also called the Red Book of Talgarth, dates to the turn of the fifteenth century. The manuscript was compiled for a nobleman called Hopcyn ap Thomas ab Einion of Ynystawe, north of Swansea~\autocite[lvii]{Eva_Welsh88}.

\Acrlong{ctd22} dates to the first half of the fifteenth century, not long after 1429~\autocite{Eva_Welsh88}. The writer of the manuscript is thought by \textcite[107]{Pow_description81} to be from South Wales. He based this on some dialectal forms found in the manuscript.

\subsection{The relationship between the manuscripts}
\label{sec:relat-betw-manuscr}
\textcite{Eva_Welsh88} discusses the relationship of the manuscripts:

\tqt{It appears that [\gls{ll27}] and [\gls{ctd22}] [\dots] derive originally from the same archetype, which is now lust, but which was different from [\gls{j119}]. That text and [\gls{j119}] must have come either directly or indirectly from the same text, which, however, could hardly have been the original copy. All extant copies have inherited errors made by an early copyist in an earlier text from which they all derive. This earlier text must have been itself a copy, made not long after the original composition of the work in the first half of the fourteenth century. It should be noted here that there are few serious textual divergences among the manuscripts.}{Eva_Welsh88}{lviii}

He posits a stemma for the extant manuscripts, which based on his wording above I reconstruct as in Figure~\ref{fig:stemmadewievans}.

\section{Some examples from \mw{Buchedd Dewi}}
\label{sec:some-examples-from}
Before showing the results, I list some examples that are not included in the databse because readings diverge too much between manuscripts to simply be counted as data points. Alternatively, they do not constitute lenition in the morphophonemic sense, but still show relevant orthographical variation. 
\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:odalymj119]{\gls{j119} 93r.1}{Yma y treithir o ach deỽi ac o \al{dalym} o'e uuched}{Here the lineage of Dewi and part of his life are discussed.}
  \mwc[ex:odalymll27]{\gls{ll27} 62v.22}{val hynn y treythir o ach dewi ac o \al{beth} o'e vuched a'e wyrtheu}{Like this the lineage of Dewi and a part of his life and his miracles are discussed.}
  \mwc[ex:odalymctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 138r.1}{yma y treithir o ach dewi ac o \al{dalym} oe vuched}{Here the lineage of Dewi and a part of his life are discussed.}
\end{mwl}
Here, we see both \mw[part]{dalym} and \mw[partj]{beth} used. Both of these words start with a voiceless stop in their radical form, but they are different words. It is not obvious which one is the original reading, and it is therefore impossible to say which of these readings are orthographical updates to an original \mw[]{t} or \mw[]{p}, and which readings are later additions.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:ogaryatj119]{\gls{j119} 93v.9--10}{A thra diodeuy laỽer \al{o garyat} duỽ}{And although you suffer much for love of God.}
  \mwc[ex:ogaryatll27]{\gls{ll27} 63r.23}{a thi a odefy lawer yno \al{yr kareat} ar duỽ}{And there you suffer much for love of God.}
  \mwc[ex:ogaryatctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 139r.1--2}{a thi a diodefy lawer yno \al{yr karyat} duỽ}{And there you suffer much for love of God.}
\end{mwl}
Here, \gls{j119}'s \mw[out of love]{o garyat} is not matched by the same construction in the other manuscripts. In the other manuscripts, this word does not stand in a position that would cause it to be lenited. Again, it is difficult to say which of these readings is the original one.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:dosdij119]{\gls{j119} 94r.9}{dos \al{ti} heb y sant}{``Come,'' said the saint}
  \mwc[ex:dosdill27]{\gls{ll27} 63v.16--17}{Dos \al{di} heb y sant}{``Come,'' said the saint}
  \mwc[ex:dosdictd22]{\gls{ctd22} 139v.10--11}{Dos \al{di} heb y sant}{``Come,'' said the saint}
\end{mwl}
Lenition in \mw[you]{ti/di} is optional here, as lenition does not impinge on grammaticality or meaning in any way. It is an instance of petrification. Still, the contrast between unlenited and lenited forms provides evidence that scribes changed the orthography between \mw[]{t} and \mw[]{d}, even if this specific example does not tell us which one is the original.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:ysgotj119]{\gls{j119} 95v.20--21}{Ac yna yd argannuv tyỽyssaỽc a elỽit boya. Ac \al{yscot} oed y mỽc hỽnnỽ}{And then the prince who was called Boya, and he was a Irishman, discovered that smoke.}
  \mwc[ex:ysgotll27]{\gls{ll27} 65r.8--9}{Ac yna yd arganvu tywyssaỽc a elwit boya \al{o gysgot} y mỽc hỽnnỽ}{And then the prince who was called Boya from shadow discovered that smoke.}
  \mwc[ex:ysgotctd22]{\gls{ctd22}142r--142v.15--1}{ac yna yd arganuu tywyssaỽc a elwit boya ac \al{yscott} oed.\ y niver hỽnnỽ}{And then the prince who was called Boya, and he was a Irishman, discovered that number.}
\end{mwl}
Here, we find both \mw[Irishman]{yscot} and \mw[from shadow]{o gysgod}. The former reading is the uncorrupted one, as the Latin has \lat{Scottus}~\autocite[155]{Wad_Vitae13}.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:wdostij119]{\gls{j119} 97v.1--2}{Tidi ỽrda gỽnuydedic pony \al{ỽdosti} heb ef}{``You, blessed nobleman, do you not know?'', said he.}
  \mwc[ex:wdostill27]{\gls{ll27} 66r.24}{Tydi wr da gỽynuydedic pony wdost \al{di} heb ef}{``You, blessed nobleman, do you not know?'', said he.}
  \mwc[ex:wdostictd22]{\gls{ctd22} 145r.3--4}{Tydi wrda gỽynuededic pony wdost \al{ti} heb ef}{``You, blessed nobleman, do you not know?'', said he.}
\end{mwl}
This example shows grammatically and semantically trivial variation between \mw[you]{ti} and \mw[]{di}, and is exactly equivalent to Examples~\ref{ex:dosdij119}, \ref{ex:dosdill27}, and \ref{ex:dosdictd22}.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:eistebawpj119]{\gls{j119} 98r.9}{A gỽedy eiste \al{paỽb} yn y mod y dylyynt}{And after everybody sitting in the way they ought to}
  \mwc[ex:eistebawpll27]{\gls{ll27} 66v.24}{A gỽedy eisted \al{o baỽp} yn y mod y dylyynt}{And after everybody sitting in the way they ought to}
  \mwc[ex:eistebawpctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 146r.4--5}{a gỽedy eisted \al{o baỽp} yn y mod y dylyynt}{And after everybody sitting in the way they ought to}
\end{mwl}
Both readings --- \mw[everyone sitting]{eiste paỽb, eisted o baỽp} --- are equally valid, but lenition is only expected in the latter reading. It is therefore impossible to say whether expected lenition is represented in all cases, because it is not expected in all readings.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:aeprouassamj119]{\gls{j119} 99r.2--3}{A ni \al{a'e prouassam} pob eilỽers.}{And we proved it one by one.}
  \mwc[ex:aeprouassamll27]{\gls{ll27} 67v.7}{a ni \al{a'e profassam} bob eilwers.}{And we proved it one by one.}
  \mwc[ex:aeprouassamctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 147v.3}{a ni \al{a prouassam} bob eilwers.}{And we proved one by one.}
\end{mwl}
It is unclear here whether the infixed object particle \mw[him]{'e} is added to account for lack of lenition in Examples~\ref{ex:aeprouassamj119} and \ref{ex:aeprouassamll27}, or alternatively lack of lenition in \ref{ex:aeprouassamctd22} is due to the deletion of the object particle. Because two readings are reconstructable, the example cannot be counted.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:trydedweithj119]{\gls{j119} 99v.6}{a rodes \al{tryded} ỽeith o gyduundeb yr holl seint}{And he gave a third time of agreement of all the saints.}
  \mwc[ex:trydedweithll27]{\gls{ll27} 68r.4--5}{Ar \al{dryded} weith o gytuundeb yr hoỻ seint}{And the third time of agreement of all the saints.}
  \mwc[ex:trydedweithctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 148v.2--3}{ar \al{dryded} weith o gyttundeb yr holl seint}{And the third time of agreement of all the saints.}
\end{mwl}
Here, \mw[third]{tryded} is found in leniting position in \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}, but not in \gls{j119}.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:advgynj119]{\gls{j119} 100v.13--14}{gann dyrchauel ohonaỽ y benn brynn vchel y lle y buassei bregeth \al{kynn} o hynny}{by his rising to the top of the high hill, the place where a sermon had been before that.}
  \mwc[ex:advgynll27]{\gls{ll27} 68v.22--23}{gan dyrchafel ohonaỽ y benn brynn uchel.\ y lle y buassei bregeth \al{kynn} no hynny.}{by his rising to the top of the high hill, the place where a sermon had been before that.}
  \mwc[ex:advgynctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 150r.11--12}{gan drychafel ohanaỽ y ben bryn uchel.\ y lle y buassei pregeth \al{gyn} no hynny}{by his rising to the top of the high hill, the place where ha sermon had been before that.}
\end{mwl}
Here, we see \mw[before]{gyn} being lenited in \gls{ctd22}. This lenition could be thought of as an instance of adverb lenition, because \mw[before that]{gyn no hynny} is an adverbial phrase to the verb. However, \mw[before]{gyn} is not typically lenited in this position in \gls{mw} or even \gls{mow}, perhaps because it may be analysed as a conjunction rather than an adverb. 

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:yngynj119]{\gls{j119} 100v.24}{ac yn \al{gynn gyffredinet}}{And as common as}
  \mwc[ex:yngynll27]{\gls{ll27} 69r.5}{ac yn \al{gyffredinet}}{And [as] common as}
  \mwc[ex:yngynctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 150v.6}{ac yn \al{gyn gyffredinet}}{And as common as}
\end{mwl}
The word \mw[]{gyn} is erroneously removed in \gls{ll27}. The sentence is ungrammatical without it, so its removal is a scribal error. Still, we cannot know now whether \gls{ll27} would have had \mw[]{cyn} or \mw[]{gyn} otherwise, so this instance cannot be counted.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:thangneuedj119]{\gls{j119} 101v.23}{arglỽyd kymer dy ỽas \al{y'thangneued}.}{Lord, take your servant to your peace.}
  \mwc[ex:thangneuedll27]{\gls{ll27} 69v.19--20}{arglỽyd kymer dy was \al{y'th dangnefed}.}{Lord, take your servant to your peace.}
  \mwc[ex:thangneuedctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 152r.10}{arglỽyd kymer di dy was \al{y'th dagneued}.}{Lord, take your servant to your peace.}
\end{mwl}
Here, Example~\ref{ex:thangneuedj119} from \gls{j119} has \mw[]{y thangneued} for \mw[your peace]{y'th dangneued}. Perhaps the scribe of \gls{j119} erroneously interpreted the expression as `her peace', which does not make sense in context. This does beg the question what sort of exemplar would invite such an erroneous reading. Hypothetical \mw[]{tht} in *\mw[]{ythtangneued} could perhaps be mistaken for an archaic spelling of /θ/. If so, this example is evidence that \gls{j119}'s exemplar did not have orthographic lenition here.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{j119} 102v.1--2}{Yna y gỽelut ti \al{gyfuredec} gann seint yr ynys honn.}{There you saw an assembly of the saints of this island}
  \mwc[]{\gls{ll27} 70r.19--20}{Yna y gỽelit \al{kyfredec} gan seint yr ynys honn.}{There an assembly was seen of the saints of this island.}
  \mwc[]{\gls{ctd22} 153r.10--11}{yna y gỽelit \al{ymgyfredec} gan seint yr enys hon.}{There an assembly was seen of the saints of this island.}
\end{mwl}
Here, we see the versions vacillating between interpreting \mw[]{gwelit} as a second-person singular and as an impersonal form. The former of these may optionally cause object lenition, but impersonal forms never cause object lenition~\autocite{van_development14}. Moreover, \mw[assembly]{ymgyfredec} cannot be compared to the other forms because it starts with a vowel.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:missingsj119]{\gls{j119} 102v.21--22}{A gỽedy daruot idaỽ rodi y venndith y baỽp.}{And after it happened to him that he gave his blessing to everyone.}
  \mwc[ex:missingsctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 154r.1--3}{A gwedy daruot ydaỽ rodi y vendith y baỽp}{And after it happened to him that he gave his blessing to everyone.}
\end{mwl}

The whole sentence found in Examples~\ref{ex:missingsj119} and~\ref{ex:missingsctd22} is missing in \gls{ll27}.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results-1}
As can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:replendewi}, lenition of \mw[]{c} is represented in nearly all instances. The other consonants are represented less regularly.

  \caption{Percentual representation of lenition of voiceless stops in the various recensions of \mw[]{Buchedd Dewi}.}
  \label{fig:barchartdewi}
\end{figure}


Non-representation of lenited \mw[]{c} is found in three instances. In all three instances, we are dealing with free lenition, which tends to be applied inconsistently in Middle Welsh:


The consistency with which lenition of \mw[]{c} is written implies that the Welsh exemplar was written at a time when lenited \mw[]{c} was already written with \mw[]{g}. This pattern of writing lenition of \mw[]{c}, but not \mw[]{p, t} is found from the second half of the thirteenth century onwards. This is evidence that \textcite{Rob_Ystoriaeu11} was right in positing the late thirteenth century as the time when the Welsh translation was composed.

Lenition of the remaining two consonants, \mw[]{p, t}, is written inconsistently. For these consonants, there are two possible scenarios: either lenition is added independently in each of the three manuscripts, or it is added in a common exemplar and then copied by two or three of these manuscripts. Quantitative methods may help in deciding between each of these scenarios.


\section{A statistical excursus}
\label{sec:statistical-excursus}


Chapter~\todo{laws}\ref{cha:welsh-laws} shows that texts originally composed in the thirteenth century and then copied in the fourteenth century replace \mw{p, t, c} for lenited voiceless stops with \mw{b, d, g}, but that they never do so completely. Chapter~\todo{brut}\ref{cha:indep-comp-mwbr} shows that original texts composed from the fourteenth century onwards do write lenited voiceless stops with \mw{b, d, g} consistently.

Taking the insights from these two chapters together, we are able to test whether a Welsh text found in the fourteenth century or later has a Welsh-language ancestor from the thirteenth century or earlier. If lenition of voiceless stops is represented haphazardly, this is evidence it dates from before the fourteenth century. Subfigure~\ref{sfig:pre1250} illustrates this scenario. If lenition of voiceless stops is written consistently, then there is no evidence of a pre-fourteenth-century composition. Subfigure~\ref{sfig:post1250} illustrates this scenario.

It is also possible to diagnose whether two exemplars of a text originally composed in the thirteenth century or earlier have a shared common ancestor from after the thirteenth century. Subfigure~\ref{sfig:intermediate} illustrates this scenario. If we hypothesise that two texts have a stemma of the type found in Subfigure~\ref{sfig:intermediate}, we would expect partial orthographic lenition of voiceless stops in both manuscripts, but the specific instances of lenition or lack thereof would agree with each other in more instances than what would be expected from chance.

    \end{forest}}
  \caption{Hypothetically reconstructable stemmata based on the orthography of lenited voiceless stops.}
  \label{fig:possiblestemmata}
\end{figure}

The scenario of Subfigure~\ref{sfig:post1250} is easy to differentiate from the scenarios of Subfigure~\ref{sfig:pre1250} and Subfigure~\ref{sfig:intermediate}: the only thing one would have to check is whether lenition of voiceless stops is represented consistently. It is harder to differentiate between the remaining two scenarios. In the scenario of Subfigure~\ref{sfig:pre1250}, haphazard lenition would be found in both surviving manuscripts, but lenition or lack thereof would not correspond to one another to a degree beyond what would be predicted by chance. In order to argue for the scenario of Subfigure~\ref{sfig:intermediate}, one would have to demonstrate that the orthography of lenited voiceless stops agrees in so many specific instances that the partial addition of orthographically lenited voiceless stops is unlikely to be due to chance.

We can only say that a pattern is unlikely to be due to chance if we actually know what chance looks like. It is therefore necessary to form a picture of what chance would look like. The expected percentage of instances agreeing between manuscripts X and Y would be calculated as follows:
\[P(\text{X} = \text{Y}) = (P(\text{len.X}) \times P(\text{len.Y})) + (P(\text{len.X}^C) \times P(\text{len.Y}^C))\]
Here, \(P\) stands for the probability of the event in brackets following it, so \(P(\text{X}=\text{Y})\) stands for the probability of manuscript X and Y agreeing, \(P(\text{len.X})\) stands for the rate by which lenition is added in manuscript X, and \(P(\text{len.Y})\) means the same thing for manuscript Y. The \(^C\) stands for the complement of an event, \ie the event not happening. So, the equation above may be phrased as: the probability of X and Y independently agreeing on orthographical lenition is equal to the product of their respective probabilities of adding lenition plus the product of their respective probabilities of not adding lenition.

To make this formula more concrete, let's assume manuscript X adds orthographical lenition in 60\% of its instances, and manuscript Y adds orthographical lenition in 30\% of its instances. X and Y do not share a common ancestor that postdates orthographical lenition. In this case, the expected probability of X and Y agreeing on the orthography of lenition in a specific instance would be:

\[(0.6 \times 0.3) + (0.4 \times 0.7) = 0.18 + 0.28 = 0.46\]

So, any instance of a lenited voiceless stop would have an 18\% probability of being orthographically represented in both manuscripts by coincidence, and would have a 28\% probability of not being represented in both manuscripts. They would thus have a probability of 46\% of agreeing. A corpus of 100 instances of lenition of voiceless stops would be expected find 46 in agreement, and 54 in disagreement.

What kind of patterns should we ascribe to common inheritance of orthographical lenition? First of all, chance can be the cause of every single pattern, so it is never impossible to exclude coincidence as the cause for a group of extremely similar looking manuscripts. We can merely reject chance as a factor because it is \emph{unlikely} to have been the cause of a particular pattern, not because it is \emph{impossible}.

Sciences employing quantitative methods typically reject the null hypothesis if a correlation at least as strong as the observed results has a lower than one in twenty probability of being observed due to chance.  The null hypothesis is the hypothesis that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena. In this case, it would be the hypothesis that the orthography of lenition in manuscript X is unrelated to that in manuscript Y, \ie lenition is added independently in two manuscripts. The opposite of the null hypothesis is the alternative hypothesis, which is the hypothesis that two measured phenomena are related. In this case, this would mean that the orthography of lenition in two mansucripts is related through a common ancestor.

\subsection{Simulating the null hypothesis in R}
\label{sec:simul-null-hypoth}

In order to find out whether the occurrences of lenition of \mw[]{p, t} in \gls{j119}, \gls{ll27}, and \gls{ctd22} occur independently of one another, one would have to simulate a scenario where lenition occurs to the same degree as is found in two of our manuscripts, but is distributed randomly\footnote{I exclude lenition of \mw[]{c} here, because it appears inherited.}. Then, one would have to see what percentage of lenition and non-lenition is shared between two manuscripts in such a scenario. These results may then be compared to the observed results in order to see how far removed the observed results are from the expected results.

This is exactly what I have done using a programming language for statistical computing called R. I have written a function\todo{I should include the code for this function in an appendix} that takes the following values as its input:
\begin{itemize}
\item Corpus size, \ie the amount of data points to be simulated for
  each manuscript;
\item Amount of instances of lenition in MS 1;
\item Amount of instances of lenition in MS 2;
\end{itemize}
As its output, it returns four numbers:
\begin{itemize}
\item AA, \ie the amount of shared archaisms between MS 1 \& 2;
\item AI, \ie the amount of archaisms in MS 1 that are innovations in MS 2;
\item IA, \ie the amount of innovations in MS 1 that are archaisms in MS 2;
\item II, \ie the amount of shared innovations between MS 1 \& 2.
\end{itemize}

Running this function once creates a single set of four numbers showing one instance of the values randomly distributed lenition could generate. Running this function many times over with the same input allows one to calculate the mean value for each of these numbers. It also generates a distribution of these values. Such a distribution of values arising from a simulation makes it possible to calculate the percentile observed values fall in. A percentile is a measure indicating the value below which a given percentage of observations fall. So if we simulate a 100 values, and 80 per cent of these simulated values are lower than or equal to the observed value, then we can say that the observed value falls in the 80\textsuperscript{th} percentile.

If an observed value falls within the 95\textsuperscript{th} percentile of all simulated values, then we can say that the probability that the simulation would return a value at least as high is lower than five per cent. In other words, the probability of the observed value being at least as high as it is would be lower than five per cent. If this is the case, the observed value may be said to be statistically significant.

In addition to this function, a statistical test called Pearson's chi-squared test (\(\chi^2\)) may be applied. This test allows one to assess whether the  observations on two or more variables are independent of each other. When this probability that the observations are independent is lower than five per cent (\emph{p} < 0.05), a correlation is usually held to exist.

\subsection{The relationship between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}}
\label{sec:relat-betw-glsll27}

The observed values for the relationship between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} are found in Table~\ref{tab:obsll27ctd22}. 

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccddd}
    \toprule
    &  &   \tchhh{\gls{ll27}}   \\
    &    & \tch{A}  & \tch{I} & \tch{Total}\\
    \multirow{3}{*}{\gls{ctd22}} & A  & 6  & 8 & 14\\
    & I  & 13 & 90 & 103\\
    & Total & 19 & 98 & 117\\\bottomrule
  \end{tabular}%
  \caption{Observed values for the relationship between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}}
  \label{tab:obsll27ctd22}
\end{table}

The corpus size is 117. Lenition of \mw[]{p, t} is represented in 103 instances in \gls{ll27}, and in 98 instances in \gls{ctd22}. The expected amount of shared innovations is calculated by multiplying the product of the respective rates of lenition by the corpus size (\(N\)):

\[P(\text{len.\gls{ll27}}) \times P(\text{len.\gls{ctd22}}) \times N = \frac{103}{117} \times \frac{98}{117} \times 117 \approx 86 \]

So we would expect 86 forms to be lenited in both \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}, compared to the observed 90 forms. The expected amount of shared archaisms is similarly calculated, only the complement of the rate of lenitionis used, \ie the rate of non-lenition:

\[P(\text{len.\gls{ll27}}^C) \times P(\text{len.\gls{ctd22}}^C) \times N = \frac{117-103}{117} \times \frac{117-98}{117} \times 117 \approx 2 \]

So we would expect about 2 forms to be lenited in both texts, compared to the observed 6 forms. Both the observed shared archaisms (AA) and the observed shared innovations (II) are more numerous than their expected counterparts. This gives credence to the idea that the specific instances of lenition of \mw[]{p, t} in \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} are inherited through a common ancestor. All expected values are given in Table~\ref{tab:expll27ctd22}. However, we have not yet calculated the probability of this distribution occurring by chance.

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{ccddd}

  \label{tab:expll27ctd22}
\end{table}

Using my own function in R, I performed 1000 simulations of two manuscripts with 117 data points, with the first manuscript having 103 instances of lenition, and the second having 98, just like \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}. The function then counted how many data points fell in each of the four categories (AA, AI, IA, II). The observed numbers of agreement compared to these simulations  corresponded to the percentiles given in Table~\ref{tab:percentilesll27ctd22}.

\begin{table}[htbp]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{ccdd}
    \toprule
       &    & \tchh{\gls{ll27}}   \\
       &    & \tch{A}  & \tch{I} \\
    \multirow{2}{*}{\gls{ctd22}} & A  & 99.8 & 0.0 \\
       & I  & 93.5 & 99.8 \\\bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
    \caption{Percentiles }
    \label{tab:percentilesll27ctd22}%
\end{table}%

Table~\ref{tab:percentilesll27ctd22} must be read as follows: the percentile 99.8 means that 99.8\% of simulations yielded a value equal to or lower than the observed value, and 0.2\% yielded a higher value. Therefore, any result corresponding to a percentile greater than 95 or lesser than 5 is significant, because the probability of such a result is lower than 5\%.

Additionally, the chi-squared test allows us to test whether the rows and columns are associated to a statistically significant degree, \ie whether there is a correlation between the orthography of lenition in \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}. It is calculated as follows:
\[\chi^2=\sum{\frac{(o-e)^2}{e}}\]
Here, \(o\) stands for an observed value, \ie the value given in Table~\ref{tab:obsll27ctd22}, and \(e\) stands for an expected value, \ie the value given in Table~\ref{tab:expll27ctd22}. A chi-squared test performed on the data of Table~\ref{tab:obsll27ctd22} yields the following result: \(\chi^2\) = 8.2835, yielding \emph{p} = 0.004001 at one degree of freedom, so the correlation between the orthography of lenition in \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} is  significant at p < .05. The contribution of each cell towards the total \(\chi^2\) statistic may be calculated as follows:
\[\frac{(o-e)^2}{e}\]
This allows one to quantify how much each cell value contributes to the significance of the result. In our case, this allows us to disambiguate whether it is the shared archaisms or the shared innovations that make the correlation between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} statistically significant.

\end{table}

These calculations tell us the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of archaisms and innovations shared between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} is beyond what we may attribute to chance.
\item The amount of shared archaisms between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} is the furthest removed from what would be expected from chance, compared to shared innovations or archaisms in one manuscript that are innovations in another.

\subsection{The evidentiary value of these tests}
\label{sec:evidence-from-these}

The p-value is well below .05 for all three combinations of manuscripts. From these observations we may conclude that lenition of \mw[]{p, t} was added to an exemplar common to all three manuscripts. This means we may reconstruct the stemma found in Figure~\ref{fig:stemmachisquare}.

\begin{figure}[h]

  \end{forest}
  \caption{Stemma of  \mw[]{Buchedd Dewi} as far as the \(\chi^2\)-tests are concerned.}
  \label{fig:stemmachisquare}
\end{figure}

We were able to confirm the date of the original Welsh translation (manuscript α) to the second half of the thirteenth century based on its representation of lenited \mw{c} alone. We may similarly date manuscript \textit{β} to around 1400 or later, because this is when lenition of \mw{p, t} was written. 

A comparison of Figure~\ref{fig:stemmachisquare}. with Figure~\ref{fig:stemmadewievans} on page \pageref{fig:stemmadewievans} shows that the \(\chi^2\)-tests are able to confirm the existence of hypothetical manuscript \textit{β}, but it does not provice evidence for any further division between the manuscripts, so it is unable to confirm the existence or the position of a manuscript \textit{γ} hypothesised by Evans.



\section{Beyond statistics again}
\label{sec:beyond-stat-again}
The statistics demonstrate that there is a correlation between whether an instance of \mw{p, t} is lenited in two manuscripts, and this correlation is found for every single pairing of manuscripts. This demonstrates that there is a common core of lenited \mw[]{p, t} inherited from a single manuscript, although more instances were added independently in each manuscript. 

However, there still remains the possibility that the orthography of lenition correlates in two manuscripts for other reasons than common inheritance. This takes us back to the realm of philology, but statistics do help in identifying these correlations in the first place.

We saw that the largest contributions made to the \(\chi^2\)-statistic came from the shared archaisms, so the observed amounts of shared archaisms depart the most from their expected counterparts. This begs the question what these examples are, and what they have in common. 

% Let's take a closer look at one example, the instance of \mw[as {[}the{]} kingdom]{yn teyrnas}:

% \begin{mwl}
%   \mwc[ex:ynteyrnasj119]{\gls{j119} 99r.17--21}{a mi heb ef a ỽeleis angel yn dyuot attaỽ ac yn galỽ arnaỽ ac yn erchi idaỽ vynet y ỽlat y gyuanhedu y lle a barchassei duỽ idaỽ yn teyrnnas demetica. Sef yỽ honno mynyỽ yn y deheu.}{``And I,'' said he, ``saw an angel coming towards him and calling to him and requesting him to go to the country to settle the place that God kept apart for him in/as the kingdom of Dyfed. This is that kingdom: Mynyw in the south.''}
%   \mwc[ex:ynteyrnasll27]{\gls{ll27} 67v.20--23}{a mi a weleis heb ef angel yn dyuot attaỽ ac yn galỽ arnaỽ. ac yn erchi idaỽ vynet y wlat y gyfanhedu y ỻe a barchassei duỽ idaỽ yn teyrnas demetica. Sef yỽ honno mynyỽ yn y deheu.}{``And I saw,'' said he, ``an angel coming towards him and calling to him and requesting him to go to the country to settle in the place that God kept apart for him in/as the kingdom of Dyfed. This is that kingdom: Mynyw in the south.''}
%   \mwc[ex:ynteyrnasctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 148r.3--7}{a mi a weleis heb ef agel yn dyuot attaỽ ac yn galỽ arnaỽ ac yn erchi idaỽ vynet y wlat y gyuanhedu y lle a barthassei duỽ ydaỽ y teyrnas demetica. sef yỽ honno mynyỽ yn y deheu.}{``And I saw,'' said he, ``an angel coming towards him and calling to him and requesting him to go to the country to settle in the place that God kept apart for him in/as the kingdom of Dyfed. This is that kingdom: Mynyw in the south.''}
% \end{mwl}

% In \gls{mow}, the verb \mow[divide]{parthu} goes with the \mow[into]{yn} which causes lenition, as can be seen from some of their examples in~\textcite[s.v.~\textit{parthaf; parthu}]{bevan_geiriadur_2014}:  `\mow{parthodd ef J bobyl yn dair byddin}. [\dots] \mow{wrth barthu‘r gramar, yn bedair colofn}'. The verb \mow[]{parchu} in the meaning of `keep apart, ordain' is somewhat rare and does not have any examples followed by \mow[]{yn} save for the one in \mw[]{Buchedd Dewi} discussed here. Under this analysis orthographic lenition is indeed expected but lacking in \mw[]{teyrnas}. On the other hand, the next sentence identifies not Dyfed, but Mynyw as the area kept apart. Mynyw lies in Dyfed, so \mw[]{yn} should be analysed as the \mw[]{yn} causing nasalisation rather than lenition, disqualifying this instance as a shared lack of orthographical lenition, as there is no lenition in the first place. In this case, a better translation would perhaps be `the place that God kept apart for him in the kingdom of Dyfed, namely Mynyw in the south'.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:hyttrannoethj119]{\gls{j119} 96v.9--10}{Ac yna deỽi ae disgyblon a dyrỽwestassant y nos honno hyt \al{trannoeth}.}{}
  \mwc[ex:hyttrannoethll27]{\gls{ll27} 65v.15--16}{Ac yna dewi ae disgyblon a dyrwestassant y nos honno hyt \al{trannoeth}.}{}
  \mwc[ex:hyttrannoethctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 143v.6--8}{ac yna dewi ae disgyblon a dyrwestassant y nos honno hyt \al{trannoeth}.}{}
\end{mwl}

This instance contains a \gls{doubconclus} of \mw{-t t-}. Because of this environment, non-representation of lenition could be argued to be trivial, because there is no phonological lenition to be represented in the first place. On the other hand, it could be argued that the very fact that writing lenition is optional here makes these instances good candidates for analysing the relationship between different manuscript versions.

In the particular case of the example above this point is moot. All three manuscripts lack orthographical lenition, so they cannot be used to triangulate the exact relationship between them. However, the next example supports the argument that non-leniting phonological value do have evidential value in stemmatics, because non-lenition and lenition sometimes stand in opposition in this phonological environment.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:ynysprydeinj119]{\gls{j119} 101r.18--19}{Ac vrth hynny y gỽnaethpỽyt deỽi sant yn tyỽyssaỽc ac yn pennadur ar seint ynys \al{prydein}}{}
  \mwc[ex:ynysprydeinll27]{\gls{ll27} 69r.22--23}{Ac ỽrth hynny y gỽnaethpỽyt dewi sant yn bennadur ac yn tywyssaỽc ar seint ynys \al{prydein}.}{}
  \mwc[ex:ynysprydeinctd22]{\gls{ctd22} 151r.11--12}{ac ỽrth hynny y gỽnaethpỽyt dewi sant yn bennadỽr.\ ac yn dywyssaỽc ar seint ynys \al{prydein}.}{}
\end{mwl}

Here, the non-lenition of  consonant cluster \mw{-s \gls{T}-} is also expected from a phonological point of view, but many other instances of \mw{-s \gls{T}-} do write lenition, \ie \mw[island of Britain]{ynys brydein}. All other occasions in \gls{ctd22} show lenition, and so does one instance in \gls{ll27}\footnote{These examples are found in the following locations: \gls{ll27} 69.15 and \gls{ctd22} 147r.12, 151r.2, 151r.10, and 151v.2.}. This makes this particular shared archaism non-trivial from an orthographic point of view, so the existence of this variation in orthography implies that non-leniting consonant clusters may be used in establishing the stemmatic relationship between  manuscripts. 

All other shared archaisms are instance where exactly one manuscript has lenition represented. These are the following:

Note how these are quite frequently a type of free lenition, \eg object lenition or parenthesis. 

\section{Free lenition}
\label{sec:points-where-one}
At this point it is worthwhile to make a qualitative division between different types of lenition. One obvious way to do this is to separate contact lenition from free lenition. Contact lenition is triggered when the lenited word immediately follows a morpheme whose property is to cause lenition, while free lenition is triggered under specific syntactic circumstances. The latter type is usually a post-apocope innovation, and continues to win ground over the course of the \gls{mw} period. As such, free lenition is less frequently found in earlier texts, but later copies tend to disproportionately introduce free lenition. This makes free lenition particularly suitable for analyzing the development of orthographical lenition in the textual history of \mw[]{Buchedd Dewi}.

\end{figure}

Figure~\ref{fig:contfreelendewi} shows how many instances of orthographical lenition are represented 0, 1, 2, or 3 times in the three manuscripts, and divides them between contact lenition and free lenition. The zero instances of free lenition not represented in any manuscript are a result of the methodology used in deciding what should go in the database: because free lenition is applied inconsistently in \gls{mw}, I only record representation if at least one manuscript represents it.

More significant is the fact that free lenition is comparatively more frequently found in one or two manuscripts only, compared to all three manuscripts. In other words: free lenition has a much higher chance of being represented inconsistently in the manuscripts. This means that any instance of free lenition has a much lower probability of being inherited from a common exemplar shared by all three manuscripts. This, in turn, confirms the hypothesis that the orthographical representation free lenition was introduced in later recensions of \mw[]{Buchedd Dewi} in a much greater degree than contact lenition. Patterns  emanating from how free lenition is shared between the manuscripts are thus strongly diagnostic in establishing a stemma of the different manuscripts.

\end{figure}
Figure~\ref{fig:vennfreelendewi} shows that no instance of represented free lenition  is shared between \gls{j119} and one other manuscript. In other words, whenever \gls{j119} shares free lenition with another manuscript, it does so with both other manuscripts. By contrast, \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} uniquely represent four instances of free lenition. Moreover, no instances of free lenition being represented are unique to \gls{ctd22}. This is evidence that \gls{ctd22} did not add the representation of lenition. Considering how it nevertheless shares free lenition with \gls{ll27}, it seems probable that representation of free lenition was added in a shared exemplar of \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}, which was not shared with \gls{j119}.

Figure~\ref{fig:vennfreelendewi} may be compared and contrasted with Figure~\ref{fig:venncontlendewi}, showing how representation of contact lenition is shared between manuscripts. Here, we see how the three circles overlap nearly completely, and the position of \gls{j119} as an outlier is less obvious than in Figure~\ref{fig:vennfreelendewi}. Still, even here we see thirteen instances of represented contact lenition shared between \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}, but not with \gls{j119}, while only three such instances are uniquely  shared between \gls{j119} and \gls{ll27}, and none at all between \gls{j119} and \gls{ctd22}.

\end{figure}



Whereas contact lenition seems to have been added by the stage of \textit{β} in the vast majority of cases, this is not the case with free lenition. This shows that the existence of node \textit{γ} hypothesized by Evans is more clearly apparent from free lenition than it is from contact lenition. Representing free lenition indeed seems to be a less trivial type of orthographical innovation than contact lenition is. That is: absence of orthographical contact lenition was more jarring to the eye of the \gls{mw} scribe than free lenition was, so emending such a textual shortcoming was more likely to occur for contact lenition than for free lenition.


Comparison of the stage at which free lenition and contact lenition may have been added shows that Evans' stemma is able to incorporate all variant readings. That is: there are no exclusive similarities between \gls{j119} and \gls{ll27} or \gls{ctd22}, just as the stemma would predict. This is not the case with contact lenition. Here, we find two instances where \gls{j119} and \gls{ll27} represent lenition, and where \gls{ctd22} does not. I will now turn to these instances.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{j119}  97r.7--9}{Gỽybydet \al{baỽp} ry lad or arglỽyd duỽ o achaỽs deỽi. boya a satarpa y ỽreic}{Everybody must know that the lord God killed, for Dewi's sake, Boya and his wife Satrapa.}
  \mwc[]{\gls{ll27}  66r.8--9}{Gỽybydet \al{baỽp} ry lad or arglỽyd duỽ boya a satrapa y wreic o achaỽs dewi.}{Everybody must know that the lord God killed Boya and his wife Satrapa, for Dewi's sake.}
  \mwc[]{\gls{ctd22} 144r.14--15}{gỽybydet \al{paỽb} ry lad or arglỽyd duỽ boya a satrapa y wreic o achos dewi.}{Gỽybydet baỽp ry lad or arglỽyd duỽ boya a satrapa y wreic o achaỽs dewi.}{Everybody must know that the lord God killed Boya and his wife Satrapa, for Dewi's sake.}
\end{mwl}

Obviously, the somewhat trivial agreement of lenition of \mw[everybody]{pawb} is overshadowed by the different position of \mw[Boya and Satrapa, his wife]{boya a satarpa y ỽreic}, especially because the word order found in \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22} is in fact the innovative one\footnote{The difference in word order is easily explained with reference to the Latin original: \lat[And nobody must doubt that the Lord, for David his servant, struck Baia and his wife.]{Nemoque dubitet quod Dominus propter Dauid seruum suum percussit Baiam et uxorem eius}~\autocite[157]{Wad_Vitae13}. This word order is quite clunky in Welsh, and was rearranged in the common ancestor of \gls{ll27} and \gls{ctd22}.}. \todo{also verbal ending causing contact lenition cf -ei -oes in MA thesis.}

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{j119} 100v.13--14}{gann dyrchauel ohonaỽ y benn brynn vchel y lle y buassei \al{bregeth} kynn o hynny}{by his rising to the top of the high hill, the place where a sermon had been before that.}
  \mwc[]{\gls{ll27} 68v.22--23}{gan dyrchafel ohonaỽ y benn brynn uchel.\ y lle y buassei \al{bregeth} kynn no hynny.}{by his rising to the top of the high hill, the place where a sermon had been before that.}
  \mwc[]{\gls{ctd22} 150r.11--12}{gan drychafel ohanaỽ y ben bryn uchel.\ y lle y buassei \al{pregeth} gyn no hynny}{by his rising to the top of the high hill, the place where ha sermon had been before that.}
\end{mwl}
NB: this sentence is also found in Examples~\ref{ex:advgynj119}, \ref{ex:advgynll27}, and \ref{ex:advgynctd22}. \todo{Business of mutation after -ei: representation of contact lenition following verbs (-ei, oes, -et) is often missed when adding lenition of p, t, c, but there is no disagreement that it SHOULD cause lenition, unlike with contact lenition. }



An account of these exceptions must fulfill two seemingly contradictory requirements in order to maintain Evans' stemma. One must on the one hand argue that it is trivial to add orthographic lenition, and that it could thus be added independently in \gls{j119} and \gls{ll27}. On the other hand, the need to emend lenition in such an example must not be so obvious that it would already have been picked up by the prime moderniser, the scribe of MS \textit{β}. Contact lenition following verbal endings seems to fulfill both of these criteria.
