\chapter{Independent compositions of \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd}}
This chapter analyses the orthography of lenition in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \lat{Historia Regum Brittanniae}, a Latin-language historical prose text which has been translated into Welsh several times.
Translations of this eleventh-century text date from the thirteenth onwards.
In total, there are some sixty manuscripts containing some sort of translation or rendition of the \lat{Historia Regum}, and they may be divided into six individual classes.
Each of these classes are individual renditions of the Latin text; some of them may be considered independent translations, and others handle the source material more freely~\autocite[xxiv-xxxi]{roberts_brut_1971}.

The existence of several independent translations or reworkings of a single text made over much of the Middle Welsh period is valuable in studying linguistic or orthographical developments.
These texts are valuable because their manuscript witnesses are often contemporaneous with the composition of their translation. Additionally, the independence of these translations from each other means that each version makes for a reliable snapshot of the language and orthography of its time and place.
Furthermore, the fact that we deal with translations of a Latin text means that any occasions where the putative existence of lenition may give rise to ambiguities may be resolved by comparing the Welsh with the Latin. 

The independence of these translations and the concurring independence of orthographies may be compared and contrasted with the law texts discussed in another chapter\todo{Refer!}.

The parts of each manuscript used comprise roughly the story of Ll\^yr
and his daughters.  Some 250 data points are taken from each
manuscript.


\section{Versions used}
Here, I discuss the manuscript witnesses of \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd}
chosen for analysis. \Gls{ll1} and \gls{p44} are some of the earliest
manuscripts, and they constitute independent translations from the
Latin:
\tqt{ Dingestow, Peniarth 44, and Llanstephan 1, all belong to the
  thirteenth century and all are close renderings of the Latin.  They
  represent three independent translations, although [\dots] the
  Dingestow and Llanstephan versions have influenced each other.
}{roberts_brut_1971}{xxix}
This makes these two manuscripts good independent snapshots of
thirteenth-century orthography.

\subsection{Llanstephan 1}
The earliest manuscript containing the \mw{Brut} is \gls{ll1}, which
is dated in the second quarter of the thirteenth century.  A part of
the manuscript contains another version, namely a fragment
of \gls{p44}. The scribe was not a translator, as may be judged from
some mistakes and omissions~\autocite[xxxvii]{roberts_brut_1971}.

This manuscript forms the basis of an edition
by \textcite{roberts_brut_1971}.  He notes the following on the
orthography of stops and on lenition, respectively:
\tqt{ Initially [b, d, g] are always deboted by \textit{b, d, g} ;
  medially they are usually represented by \textit{b, d, g}, with some
  examples of \textit{-p-, -t-, -k-}. Finally, [d] is always
  represented by \textit{t}, [g] by \textit{c} with the exception
  of \textit{og}, but final [b] is represented sometimes
  by \textit{p}, and sometimes by \textit{b, pob, pab, escyb}.  The
  unvoiced stops [p, t, k] occur initially and are written \textit{p,
    t, c/k}. \textit{c-} does not occur often and the scribe prefers
  to use \textit{k-}.  The convention of using \textit{k}
  with \textit{y, i,} or \textit{e} and \textit{c} with other vowels
  and consonants [\dots] does not seem to have been followed and the
  same word may appear with initial \textit{c-} or \textit{k-}.
  As \textit{b, d, g} medially denote [b, d, g] the corresponding
  unvoiced stops can be written \textit{p, t, tt, k, kc}
}{roberts_brut_1971}{xli}
\tqt{ Lenition of initial consonants is not always shown in the text
  but the scribe almost invariably denotes the spirant and nasal
  mutations }{roberts_brut_1971}{xlii}
It is obvious from these quotes that Roberts fails to problematise the
erratic representation of lenition.  Not only does he fail to account
for the distribution of represented and unrepresented lenitions, but
he also fails to see that there is a topic to be studied at all.

  possible.}

\subsection{Peniarth 44}
The \gls{p44} translation of the \mw{Brut} is roughly as old as the \gls{ll1} one. \Textcite{lewis_brut_1942} states that \gls{p44} and \gls{ll1} are based on a common original translation, but \textcite[xliii--xliv]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969} argues that they constitute separate traditions.


\subsection{Dingestow}
\label{sec:dingestow}
\Gls{bd} is found in the following manuscript: \gls{nlw} MS 5266.  It
is dated to the end of the thirteenth century~\autocite[xliii]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}.
An edition of this text is prepared by \textcite{lewis_brut_1942}.  His
introduction does not mention the orthography of lenition, however.

\Gls{bcc} is the latest manuscript under consideration.
It dates from the mid-fourteenth century~\autocite[xlv]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}.
The scribe of this \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd} translation is identified as scribe X89\autocite{_tei_???}. 



\section{Comparison of the versions}
\label{sec:comparison-versions}
The following sentence found in several manuscripts demonstrates how the orthography of lenition developed around the end of the thirteenth century.
Roughly speaking, Examples~\ref{ll1llyr} and \ref{p44llyr} from the mid-thirteenth century show that lenited voiceless stops were not written.
Example \ref{bdllyr} from the late thirteenth century shows lenition of \mw{g}, but not of mw{t}, and thus forms an intermediate stage before voiceless stops were all written lenited. The final stage of full lenition is found in Example~\ref{bccllyr}.
