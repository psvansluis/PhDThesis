\chapter{Independent compositions of \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd}}This chapter analyses the orthography of lenition in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \lat{Historia Regum Brittanniae}, a Latin-language historical prose text which has been translated into Welsh several times.Translations of this eleventh-century text date from the thirteenth onwards.In total, there are some sixty manuscripts containing some sort of translation or rendition of the \lat{Historia Regum}, and they may be divided into six individual classes.Each of these classes are individual renditions of the Latin text; some of them may be considered independent translations, and others handle the source material more freely~\autocite[xxiv-xxxi]{roberts_brut_1971}.The existence of several independent translations or reworkings of a single text made over much of the Middle Welsh period is valuable in studying linguistic or orthographical developments.These texts are valuable because their manuscript witnesses are often contemporaneous with the composition of their translation. Additionally, the independence of these translations from each other means that each version makes for a reliable snapshot of the language and orthography of its time and place.Furthermore, the fact that we deal with translations of a Latin text means that any occasions where the putative existence of lenition may give rise to ambiguities may be resolved by comparing the Welsh with the Latin. The independence of these translations and the concurring independence of orthographies may be compared and contrasted with the law texts discussed in another chapter\todo{Refer!}.\section{Method}\label{sec:method}From each manuscript, I have collected instances of orthographicallenition as well as instances of where orthographical lenition wouldbe expected, but is not found. The sample used comprises roughly thestory of Ll\^yr and his daughters.  Some 250 data points are takenfrom each manuscript.\Gls{petr}, both the type resulting from grammatical lenition and from clitic reduction have been collected for prepositionsand (historically) nouns, but not for personal pronouns suchas \mw[I]{mi/fi}. The reason why these forms are included --- albeitas research exceptions --- is that their orthography also changed over thethirteenth century\footnote{See \ref{sec:petrification}.}. Including them allowsus to gauge when this happened relatively to morphophonemic lenition.It is not always clear what types of lenition applied in differentstages of \gls{mw}. Particularly some types of freelenition\todo{define glossary term}, such as object lenition and NPlenition tend to be used only irregularly, or only in later texts~\autocite{van_sluis_development_2014}, butwith no distinction for consonant type. Evidence for the existence oflenition differs between texts here, precluding a catch-all policy forthe inclusion of such instances. I generally look for multiple positiveinstances attesting to the lenition of objects and nominal predicates.Consequently, I do not consider non-lenition of \mw[dead]{marỽ} inExample~\ref{ex:bvmarw} to be relevant for the orthography of lenition,because NP lenition is only found once elsewhere in this corpus in thesame sentence. This implies that lenition was grammatically optional here.\mwcc[ex:bvmarw]{\gls{ll1} 38.9--10}{en e tryded wlwydyn gwedy henny e bỽ ỽarỽ llyr.\ ac e \al{bỽ} marỽ aganyppỽs brenyn ffreync}{In the third year after this Ll\^yr died, and Aganippus, king of France, died.}\section{Versions used}Here, I discuss the manuscript witnesses of \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd}chosen for analysis. \Gls{ll1} and \gls{p44} are some of the earliestmanuscripts, and they constitute independent translations from theLatin:\tqt{ Dingestow, Peniarth 44, and Llanstephan 1, all belong to the  thirteenth century and all are close renderings of the Latin.  They  represent three independent translations, although [\dots] the  Dingestow and Llanstephan versions have influenced each other.}{roberts_brut_1971}{xxix}This makes these two manuscripts good independent snapshots ofthirteenth-century orthography.\subsection{Llanstephan 1}The earliest manuscript containing the \mw{Brut} is \gls{ll1}, whichis dated in the second quarter of the thirteenth century.  A part ofthe manuscript contains another version, namely a fragmentof \gls{p44}. The scribe was not a translator, as may be judged fromsome mistakes and omissions~\autocite[xxxvii]{roberts_brut_1971}.This manuscript forms the basis of an editionby \textcite{roberts_brut_1971}.  He notes the following on theorthography of stops and on lenition, respectively:\tqt{ Initially [b, d, g] are always deboted by \textit{b, d, g} ;  medially they are usually represented by \textit{b, d, g}, with some  examples of \textit{-p-, -t-, -k-}. Finally, [d] is always  represented by \textit{t}, [g] by \textit{c} with the exception  of \textit{og}, but final [b] is represented sometimes  by \textit{p}, and sometimes by \textit{b, pob, pab, escyb}.  The  unvoiced stops [p, t, k] occur initially and are written \textit{p,    t, c/k}. \textit{c-} does not occur often and the scribe prefers  to use \textit{k-}.  The convention of using \textit{k}  with \textit{y, i,} or \textit{e} and \textit{c} with other vowels  and consonants [\dots] does not seem to have been followed and the  same word may appear with initial \textit{c-} or \textit{k-}.  As \textit{b, d, g} medially denote [b, d, g] the corresponding  unvoiced stops can be written \textit{p, t, tt, k, kc}}{roberts_brut_1971}{xli}\tqt{ Lenition of initial consonants is not always shown in the text  but the scribe almost invariably denotes the spirant and nasal  mutations }{roberts_brut_1971}{xlii}It is obvious from these quotes that Roberts fails to problematise theerratic representation of lenition.  Not only does he fail to accountfor the distribution of represented and unrepresented lenitions, buthe also fails to see that there is a topic to be studied at all.The \todo{Some notes on the geography of its composition, if  possible.}Lenition on pages 33 to 38 was analysed.\subsection{Peniarth 44}The \gls{p44} translation of the \mw{Brut} is roughly as old as the \gls{ll1} one.\Textcite{lewis_brut_1942} states that \gls{p44} and \gls{ll1} are based on a common original translation,but according to \textcite[xliii--xliv]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}  they are based on separate translations.Lenition was analysed for pages 23 to 28.\subsection{Brut Dingestow}\label{sec:dingestow}\Gls{bd} is found in the following manuscript: \gls{nlw} MS 5266.  Itis dated to the end of the thirteenth century~\autocite[xliii]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}.An edition of this text is prepared by \textcite{lewis_brut_1942}.  Hisintroduction does not mention the orthography of lenition, however.The translation found in \gls{bd} is more free than the \gls{ll1} and \gls{p44} ones.\tqt{I ailadrodd, bu o leiaf dri pherson rywdro'n cyfieithu Historia  Sieffre i'r Gymraeg, bob un yn ei ddull ei hun.

In \gls{ll1}lenited \mw{g} is written in 49 out of 68 instances; in \gls{p44} itis written in 26 out of 72 instances.  The element causing lenitiondoes not seem to be relevant, \eg verbal particle \mw{a} regularlycauses lenition to \mw[did]{oruc}, but not to \mw[did]{gwnaeth}.The phonology of the lenited word does seem to play a role: wheninitial \mw{g} is not followed by \mw{w}, it disappears in 48 out of52 of such instances. The remaining four comprise the followinginstances: \mw[they rested]{gorffowyssassant} (\gls{ll1} 38.25),\mw[rested]{gor/ffowyssỽs} (\gls{p44} 23.9--10), \mw[gain]{gorescyn}(\gls{p44} 27.15), and \mw[glorious]{gogonedỽs} (\gls{p44}28.23). These words all used to start with \mw{g\cw}, but the \mw{\cw}has disappeared by the end of the \gls{ow} period. However, such wordsstarting with \mw{go} do sometimes write lenition, such as in theplentiful instances of \mw[did]{oruc}.The remaining 88 instances are all words starting with \mw{(g)w}. 27 of these show lenition.Table~\ref{tab:gwphon} shows that the phonological structure of these words plays an important role in dictating whether lenition is written.If the \mw{w} following lenited \mw{g} is a vowel, lenition is usually shown.An example of such a word showing lenition is \mw[husband]{wr} (\gls{ll1} 34.13).Similarly, lenition is usually shown if the quality of the following vowel is \mw{\cw}, but  this semivowel is in turn followed by a vowel, \eg \mw[wear]{wyscaỽ} (\gls{p44} 27.7).However, if the \mw{g} is followed by semivowel \mw{\cw}, and then followed by another consonant, lenition is usually not written, \eg \mw[make]{gwneỽthỽr} (\gls{p44} 27.28).This means that not representing \mw{g} served a purpose: it served to distinguish consonantal \mw{w} from its syllabic counterpart if it followed \mw{g} and preceded a consonant.\begin{table}[h]  \centering  \begin{tabular}{ldd}    \toprule    & /g\cw{}C/ & /g\cw{}V, gu/ \\    \midrule    {Lenition shown} & 3 & 24 \\    {Lenition not shown} & 48 & 13 \\    \bottomrule  \end{tabular}%  \caption{Lenition of \mw{gw} divided by phonological structure of the word.}  \label{tab:gwphon}\end{table}\section{Lenition of voiceless stops}\label{sec:lenit-voic-stops}Table~\ref{tab:perlenbrutex} shows how rarely morphophonemic lenition of \mw{p, t, c} is represented in the earlier translations of the \mw{Brut}. The orthographical development of these consonants will be discussed in this section.\subsection{Lenition in \acrshort{ll1} and \acrshort{p44}}\label{sec:lenit-acrsh-acrsh}The pattern is clear in \gls{ll1} and \gls{p44}: voiceless stops are not written lenited as a rule.Given this rule, exceptions need to be accounted for.These exceptions are found in Table~\ref{tab:ltrepll1p44}.As can be seen in this table, both the form and meaning of the words themselves and their reason for being lenited differs, so accounting for them must be done on an ad-hoc basis, and a satisfying account may not always be found.\begin{table}[h]  \centering  \begin{tabular}{lddwql}    \toprule    \tch{Source} & \tch{Page} & \tch{Line} & \tch{Word} & \tch{Translation} & \tch{Reason lenition} \\    \midrule    \acrshort{ll1} & 34 & 1 & gellweyr & jest & \mw{trwy} \\    \acrshort{ll1} & 35 & 8 & gytdỽundep & agreement & \mw{o} \\    \acrshort{ll1} & 36 & 4 & gof & memory & \mw{ar} \\

\label{tab:ltrepll1p44}\end{table}One word that may be accounted for, however, is \mw[before]{gynt} (\gls{p44} 26.2).It stands out in that it is the only lenited adverbial phrase in this source.Moreover, lenition of adverbial phrases of time is frequently petrified, \eg \gmow[yesterday]{ddoe}.The writing of \mw{gynt} with \mw{g} may similarly point to \gls{petr}, rather than \gls{morphophonlen}.If so, this word constitutes a research exception.The case of \mw[what moment?]{pa bryt} may be explained in a similar manner.Although lenition following \mw{pa} is morphophonemic and still grammatical, it occurs frequently in combination with \mw{bryt}, and orthographical lenition may thus be reminiscent of the \gls{petr} we find in research exception \mw[together]{y gyt}.Moreover, the semantics of the phrase obviously have a temporal dimension similar to \mw{gynt}.The phrase \mw{pa bryt} is also found with exceptional lenition in \gls{bd}, as can be seen in Table~\ref{tab:replenpbd}.\subsection{Lenition in \acrshort{bd} }\label{sec:lenition-acrshortbd-}In \gls{bd}, lenition is generally not represented for \mw{p, t}, and it is represented for \mw{c}.This pattern is exceptionless for \mw{t}, but both \mw{p} and \mw{c} have some exceptions to this rule.For \mw{p}, these exceptions constitute instances where lenition is represented, and for \mw{c} these exceptions constitute instances where lenition is not represented.Table~\ref{tab:replenpbd} shows the two instances of orthographically represented lenited \mw{p}, and Table~\ref{tab:nonlencbd} shows every instance where lenited \mw{c} is not orthographically represented.\begin{table}[h]  \centering  \begin{tabular}{addwql}    \toprule    \tch{Source} &

\acrshort{bcc}}\label{sec:lenition-acrshortbcc}Lenition of voiceless stops is usually represented in \gls{bcc}, so instances where lenition is not shown are the ones that need to be accounted for.Table~\ref{tab:ltnotrepbcc} shows these instances of non-represented lenition.Various reasons for lenition appear multiple times in this table.\begin{table}[h]  \centering  \begin{tabular}{lddwql}    \toprule    \tch{Source} & \tch{Page} & \tch{Line} & \tch{Word} & \tch{Translation} & \tch{Reason lenition} \\    \midrule    \gls{bcc} & 16r & 29 & prosessio &

\label{tab:ltnotrepbcc}\end{table}Within \gls{bcc}, \mw[prince]{tywyssawc} is found four times in apposition to a personal name.A lenitable noun in apposition to a personal name is found eight times within this source, and is lenited only once in \mw[prophet]{broffwid} (\gls{bcc} 16r.26).Lenition of nouns in apposition is not shown for other types of consonants either, as the word \mw[king]{brenhin} is found in unlenited form in this position also.Personal name \mw{Cordeilla} is found unlenited where lenition would be expected three times. The fact that we are dealing with a personal name here may be of influence, as \mw{llyr} is found unlenited following \mw[fort]{caer} twice. Furthermore, personal names are not as a rule lenited in \gls{mow}. These instances of \mw{llyr} and \mw{Cordeilla} may be early examples of this \gls{mow} rule. Infixed object pronoun \mw{'th} should cause lenition \todo{or should it not?}. It does not do so here.Several words following a preposed adjective fail to show lenition, although these instances are outnumbered by preposed adjectives shown to cause lenition.Lenition following preposed adjectives is a type of free lenition, because any adjective principally causes lenition when it is used as a preposed adjective.These same adjectives do not principally cause lenition when they are in their usual postnominal position.This means that the correct application of lenition hinges on the morphosyntactic relationship between two elements in a clause rather than by simply checking whether the immediately preceding morpheme causes lenition.This morphosyntactic relationship may not always be clear, either to us or the scribes and translators of the \gls{mw} text.An example where I found it difficult to establish the exact relationship involving a supposedly preposed adjective is Example~\ref{ex:wychyrcalet}:\mwcc[ex:wychyrcalet]{\gls{bcc} 19v.3--6}{ac yn ev herbyn wynt y doeth Maglawn tywyssawc yr alban. a henwyn tywyssawc kernyw ac ev holl allu. ac ymlad yn \al{wychyr calet} ac wynt.}{And against them came Maglawn, prince of Scotland, and Henwyn, prince of Cornwall, and their whole capability, and they fought them \al{violently hard}.}What exactly is the grammatical relationship between \mw[violent]{wychyr} and \mw[hard]{caled}?Is \mw{wychyr} a preposed adjective, translating to the translation given, or does \mw{caled} modify \mw{wychyr}?In the latter case, `toughly violent' would be a more suitable translation. Judgments like these may not be made consistently, either by me when deciding where lenition was not written, or by the translators and copyists who produced this work.%%% Local Variables:%%% coding: utf-8%%% mode: latex%%% TeX-master: "../main"%%% End:
