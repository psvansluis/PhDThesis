\chapter{Independent compositions of \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd}}
This chapter analyses the orthography of lenition in Geoffrey of Monmouth's \lat{Historia Regum Brittanniae}, a Latin-language historical prose text which has been translated into Welsh several times.
Translations of this eleventh-century text date from the thirteenth onwards.
In total, there are some sixty manuscripts containing some sort of translation or rendition of the \lat{Historia Regum}, and they may be divided into six individual classes.
Each of these classes are individual renditions of the Latin text; some of them may be considered independent translations, and others handle the source material more freely~\autocite[xxiv-xxxi]{roberts_brut_1971}.

The existence of several independent translations or reworkings of a single text made over much of the Middle Welsh period is valuable in studying linguistic or orthographical developments.
These texts are valuable because their manuscript witnesses are often contemporaneous with the composition of their translation. Additionally, the independence of these translations from each other means that each version makes for a reliable snapshot of the language and orthography of its time and place.
Furthermore, the fact that we deal with translations of a Latin text means that any occasions where the putative existence of lenition may give rise to ambiguities may be resolved by comparing the Welsh with the Latin. 

The independence of these translations and the concurring independence of orthographies may be compared and contrasted with the law texts discussed in another chapter\todo{Refer!}.



\section{Method}
\label{sec:method}
From each manuscript, I have collected instances of orthographical
lenition as well as instances of where orthographical lenition would
be expected, but is not found. The sample used comprises roughly the
story of Ll\^yr and his daughters.  Some 250 data points are taken
from each manuscript.

Petrification, both petrification of grammatical lenition and
petrification by clitic reduction have been collected for prepositions
and (historically) nouns, but not for personal pronouns such
as \mw[I]{mi/fi}. The reason why petrified clitics are included --- albeit
as research exceptions --- is that their orthography also changed over the
thirteenth century \todo{refer to section on clitics}. Including them allows
us to gauge when this happened relatively to morphophonemic lenition.

It is not always clear what types of lenition applied in different
stages of \gls{mw}. Particularly some types of free
lenition\todo{define glossary term}, such as object lenition and NP
lenition tend to be used only irregularly, or only in later texts~\autocite{van_sluis_development_2014}, but
with no distinction for consonant type. Evidence for the existence of
lenition differs between texts here, precluding a catch-all policy for
the inclusion of such instances. I generally look for multiple positive
instances attesting to the lenition of objects and nominal predicates.
Consequently, I do not consider non-lenition of \mw[dead]{marỽ} in
Example~\ref{ex:bvmarw} to be relevant for the orthography of lenition,
because NP lenition is only found once elsewhere in this corpus in the
same sentence. This implies that lenition was grammatically optional here.

\section{Versions used}
Here, I discuss the manuscript witnesses of \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd}
chosen for analysis. \Gls{ll1} and \gls{p44} are some of the earliest
manuscripts, and they constitute independent translations from the
Latin:
\tqt{ Dingestow, Peniarth 44, and Llanstephan 1, all belong to the
  thirteenth century and all are close renderings of the Latin.  They
  represent three independent translations, although [\dots] the
  Dingestow and Llanstephan versions have influenced each other.
}{roberts_brut_1971}{xxix}
This makes these two manuscripts good independent snapshots of
thirteenth-century orthography.

\subsection{Llanstephan 1}
The earliest manuscript containing the \mw{Brut} is \gls{ll1}, which
is dated in the second quarter of the thirteenth century.  A part of
the manuscript contains another version, namely a fragment
of \gls{p44}. The scribe was not a translator, as may be judged from
some mistakes and omissions~\autocite[xxxvii]{roberts_brut_1971}.

This manuscript forms the basis of an edition
by \textcite{roberts_brut_1971}.  He notes the following on the
orthography of stops and on lenition, respectively:
\tqt{ Initially [b, d, g] are always deboted by \textit{b, d, g} ;
  medially they are usually represented by \textit{b, d, g}, with some
  examples of \textit{-p-, -t-, -k-}. Finally, [d] is always
  represented by \textit{t}, [g] by \textit{c} with the exception
  of \textit{og}, but final [b] is represented sometimes
  by \textit{p}, and sometimes by \textit{b, pob, pab, escyb}.  The
  unvoiced stops [p, t, k] occur initially and are written \textit{p,
    t, c/k}. \textit{c-} does not occur often and the scribe prefers
  to use \textit{k-}.  The convention of using \textit{k}
  with \textit{y, i,} or \textit{e} and \textit{c} with other vowels
  and consonants [\dots] does not seem to have been followed and the
  same word may appear with initial \textit{c-} or \textit{k-}.
  As \textit{b, d, g} medially denote [b, d, g] the corresponding
  unvoiced stops can be written \textit{p, t, tt, k, kc}
}{roberts_brut_1971}{xli}
\tqt{ Lenition of initial consonants is not always shown in the text
  but the scribe almost invariably denotes the spirant and nasal
  mutations }{roberts_brut_1971}{xlii}
It is obvious from these quotes that Roberts fails to problematise the
erratic representation of lenition.  Not only does he fail to account
for the distribution of represented and unrepresented lenitions, but
he also fails to see that there is a topic to be studied at all.

The \todo{Some notes on the geography of its composition, if
  possible.}

Lenition on pages 33 to 38 was analysed.

\subsection{Peniarth 44}
The \gls{p44} translation of the \mw{Brut} is roughly as old as the \gls{ll1} one.
\Textcite{lewis_brut_1942} states that \gls{p44} and \gls{ll1} are based on a common original translation,
but according to \textcite[xliii--xliv]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}  they are based on separate translations.

Lenition was analysed for pages 23 to 28.
\subsection{Dingestow}
\label{sec:dingestow}
\Gls{bd} is found in the following manuscript: \gls{nlw} MS 5266.  It
is dated to the end of the thirteenth century~\autocite[xliii]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}.
An edition of this text is prepared by \textcite{lewis_brut_1942}.  His
introduction does not mention the orthography of lenition, however.

The translation found in \gls{bd} is more free than the \gls{ll1} and \gls{p44} ones.

Lenition was analysed for pages 26 to 36.
\subsection{Cotton Cleopatra B V i}
\label{sec:cotton-cleopatra-b}
\Gls{bcc} is the latest manuscript under consideration.
It dates from the mid-fourteenth century~\autocite[xlv]{roberts_astudiaeth_1969}.
The scribe of this \mw{Brut y Brenhinedd} translation is identified as scribe X89\autocite{_tei_???}. 

Lenition on folios 16r to 19v were taken for analysis.

\section{Comparison of the versions}
\label{sec:comparison-versions}
The following sentence found in several manuscripts demonstrates how the orthography of lenition developed around the end of the thirteenth century.
Roughly speaking, Examples~\ref{ll1llyr} and \ref{p44llyr} from the mid-thirteenth century show that lenited voiceless stops were not written.
Example \ref{bdllyr} from the late thirteenth century shows lenition of \mw{g}, but not of mw{t}, and thus forms an intermediate stage before voiceless stops were all written lenited. The final stage of full lenition is found in Example~\ref{bccllyr}.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ll1llyr]{\acrshort{ll1} 34.16--18}{Ac ena hep ỽn gohyr

    Cornwall and the one of Scotland.}
\end{mwl}

Table~\ref{tab:perlenbrut} confirms these impressions: only a minority of lenited \mw{p, t} is written until \gls{bcc}, while a minority of lenited \mw{c} is only written until \gls{bd}.
This result shows that the behaviour of Scribe X86 is not unique to this scribe\todo{Refer to chapter}. 

Comparison between Table~\ref{tab:perlenbrut} and Table~\ref{tab:perlenbrutex} shows that most early instances of lenited \mw{c} written with \mw{g} are in fact instances of petrified lenition. 

The only other number in Table~\ref{tab:perlenbrut} dipping below the fifty per cent mark is that of the representation of lenited \mw{g} in \gls{p44}.

\section{Lenited \mw{g}}
\label{sec:lenited-mwg}
The question rises why \mw{g} in \gls{p44} and to a lesser
extent \gls{ll1} is lenited so infrequently.  In \gls{ll1}
lenited \mw{g} is written in 49 out of 68 instances; in \gls{p44} it
is written in 26 out of 72 instances.  The element causing lenition
does not seem to be relevant, \eg verbal particle \mw{a} regularly
causes lenition to \mw[did]{oruc}, but not to \mw[did]{gwnaeth}.

The phonology of the lenited word does seem to play a role: when
initial \mw{g} is not followed by \mw{w}, it disappears in 48 out of
52 of such instances. The remaining four comprise the following
instances: \mw[they rested]{gorffowyssassant} (\gls{ll1} 38.25),
\mw[rested]{gor/ffowyssỽs} (\gls{p44} 23.9--10), \mw[gain]{gorescyn}
(\gls{p44} 27.15), and \mw[glorious]{gogonedỽs} (\gls{p44}
28.23). These words all used to start with \mw{g\cw}, but the \mw{\cw}
has disappeared by the end of the \gls{ow} period. However, such words
starting with \mw{go} do sometimes write lenition, such as in the
plentiful instances of \mw[did]{oruc}.

The remaining 88 instances are all words starting with \mw{(g)w}. 27 of these show lenition.
Table~\ref{tab:gwphon} shows that the phonological structure of these words plays an important role in dictating whether lenition is written.
If the \mw{w} following lenited \mw{g} is a vowel, lenition is usually shown.
An example of such a word showing lenition is \mw[husband]{wr} (\gls{ll1} 34.13).
Similarly, lenition is usually shown if the quality of the following vowel is \mw{\cw}, but  this semivowel is in turn followed by a vowel, \eg \mw[wear]{wyscaỽ} (\gls{p44} 27.7).
However, if the \mw{g} is followed by semivowel \mw{\cw}, and then followed by another consonant, lenition is usually not written, \eg \mw[make]{gwneỽthỽr} (\gls{p44} 27.28).
This means that not representing \mw{g} served a purpose: it served to distinguish consonantal \mw{w} from its syllabic counterpart if it followed \mw{g} and preceded a consonant.
