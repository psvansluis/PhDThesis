\section{Some quotes, tables, and stemmas}
\label{sec:some-quotes-tables}


% \tqt{One advantage which Welsh law enjoyed in the political storms of the thirteenth century was that it had a written form. Already in the twelfth century it was felt to be an embarassment if law remained unwritten. Roman law was embodied in texts, and with the great legal revival of the eleventh and twelfth centuries it was felt that any law worthy of the name should be written.

\tqt{Welsh law survives in many complete manuscripts and fragments of others. The difficulty scholars have had in coping with this wealth of material stems from two opposite truths: first, each manuscript is an individual entity in that no one manuscript presents a text exactly the same as any other; but, secondly, the manuscripts fall into groups because they share, to a greater or lesser extent, the same content. As a result there have been long terminological travails attempting to give due weight both to the variations between manuscripts and also the links between them.
}{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}{17}


\tqt{The considerable differences between the law books show that their authors were not concerned, like the Irish, to preserve intact a standard text handed down from the past.
  Linguistically, the laws are not unlike many Middle Welsh prose tales: in spite of the occasional early feature the language as a whole generally accords with the dates of the manuscripts.
}{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}{21--22}

% \tqt{{[T]}he distinction between the Versions and the Anomalous Laws lies in the existence of a certain pattern according to which it was thought that a wide-ranging account of the Law of Hywel ought to be constructed. The pattern was not immutable, as is shown by the creation of the Test Book in \textsc{Ior} or by the wide variations in the ordering of the tractates in \textsc{Cyfn}.}{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}{26}

\section{Research plan for the laws}
\label{sec:research-plan-laws}

What do I want to do?
I want to analyze where \lT\ was represented in the various law texts.

Why do I want to do this?
I want to see under what circumstances scribes copying manuscripts maintained or changed the non-representation of \lT.

Which period is suitable for this purpose?
I expect that most instances of \lT\ were represented by the mid-fourteenth century, so manuscripts up until this period are most useful to chart the change in orthography.
Later manuscripts may still show traces of the early orthography, and may thus also be included.
I will focus on the transmission of \mw{Llyfr Iorwerth}, because most of the oldest law manuscripts contain this law text.

How are various manuscripts related to each other?
It is nowadays thought that none of the earliest extant manuscripts is a direct ancestor of another extant copy.
One author who did think this was J.\ Gwenogvryn Evans (Figure~\ref{fig:gwevanslli}).
Rather, extant manuscripts are held to have common exemplars that no longer exist.
Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} gives a stemma for the Iorwerth manuscripts (and some more manuscripts), and I will use this stemma as a point of departure for my own research.

Which manuscripts may be used for analysis?
One useful manuscript is \textit{A}, the \gls{bbch}, dating from around 1250. This manuscript is one of the oldest law manuscripts, and its orthography is very unusual.
Another useful manuscript is \textit{B}, which is also fairly old, and dates from the end of the thirteenth century.
Other thirteenth-century manuscripts shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb}: \textit{EC};
early fourteenth century: \textit{G};
other manuscripts in this stemma are all later than the fourteenth century.
Some more useful manuscripts are: \textit{VW}, by scribe X86; \textit{Tr}, by Gwilym Was Da.

What sections of the law texts are useful for analysis?
Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} shows that \textit{B} was  transmitted in part from several sources. This makes both the Test Book and the Laws of Country interesting targets for analysis, as the orthography of lenition may confirm or deny this peculiar reconstruction by Charles-Edwards.
Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} also shows that different parts of the Test Book may have been added in intermediate stages between Redaction I and the extant manuscripts.
Comparison of these chunks with text found in all the manuscripts may prove useful in establishing at what point in time these chunks were added, and therefore when some of the hypothetical nodes in the stemma were written.

\subsection{The law corpus}
\label{sec:fleshed-out-research}
I will take a part of the tractate on suretyship for analysis.
This tractate is found in many manuscripts from the Iorwerth tradition, and those manuscripts vary in date of composition from the mid-thirteenth century to 1404.
To be more specific, I will use \cite[\S\S58--65]{wiliam_llyfr_1960} for analysis. These paragraphs correspond to the folio numbers, column numbers and line numbers in the manuscripts given in Table~\ref{tab:surety}. This text runs continuously in all of these manuscripts, except in \gls{sG}, where it is interspersed with other additions. A bit over 200 data points were taken from each manuscript for analysis.

\section{Some preliminary observations}
\label{sec:some-prel-observ}

MS \textit{B}, folio 42v, \S 104 has the following as the preface of the Test Book:
\mwcc[preftestb]{B 42v.}{Llyma e dechreu e Llyuer Prauf. Sef yu henne, teyr colouen keureyth guerth gyullt a dof ac a perthyn arnadunt.}{Here starts the Test Book. That is, three columns of law of wild and tame value, and what relates to them.}
Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} shows that the preface to the Test Book was added as late as Redaction II.
This one line shown in Example~\ref{preftestb} shows lenition word-internally, and there are two examples  where word-initial lenition may be expected:, \mw[columns of law]{colouen keureyth}, with lenition following a feminine noun, and \mw[that relates]{a perthyn}, with lenition following the verbal particle.
As lenition  is not written here, we may assume that Redaction II was composed before lenition of voiceless stops was written.
This is unsurprising, as one of its manuscripts, \textit{C}, is dated as early as 1250.
This somewhat trivial example serves to demonstrate how combined knowledge of when which parts were added in a stemma and of the orthography of lenition may date hypothetical nodes in a stemma. 


\section{How do manuscripts modernize?}
\label{sec:how-do-manuscripts}

How is lenition modernized in the newer manuscripts compared to the older ones?
The most obvious way of course is by simply writing lenition where no lenition was written previously. Such innovations are easily covered by simply checking to what extent each manuscript writes lenition where it should. However, there is also a more insidious way of adjusting older orthographies to newer standards.

When older manuscripts have an element that causes lenition is followed by a word starting with a voiceless stop, lenition is typically not written. Younger recensions sometimes solve this outdated orthographical convention by simply deleting the element causing lenition. This if found when comparing \gls{sD} with some of its older cousins:
\begin{mwl}
  \mwc{\gls{sB} 20v.24}{sef a wyl e keureyth ena}{This is how the law sees it}
  \mwc{\gls{sD} 54.3}{Sef a wyl kyfreith yna}{This is how [the] law sees it}
\end{mwl}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Tables~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryincre} and~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryexcre} show to what degree lenition was represented in the tractate on suretyship in various recensions of the book of Iorwerth. One obvious difference between the results shown in this table and what we see in the Brut \todo{refer to tables} is that even in the latest recensions, full consistency in writing  lenition of \mw{p, t, c} is not achieved. The latest manuscript, \gls{sD} written about 1404, still only writes lenition where it should in about three-quarters of the cases.

Another difference is found specifically by comparing the numbers between both Table~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryincre} as well as Table~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryexcre}, and concerns research exceptions, \ie instances where lenition was not synchronically morphophonemic, such as \mw[with]{gan}, or \mw[-ever]{bynnac}. The orthography of lenition in these exceptions only differs from `proper' lenition when the initial consonant is a voiceless stop. This means that degrammaticalized lenition of voiceless stops was written early on, but not grammatical lenition. The greatest differences between these percentages is found in \gls{sB}, because this manuscript both fails to write morphophonemic lenition and starts writing words like \mw[with]{gan} with a lenited grapheme. In \gls{sA}, and to a lesser degree \gls{sC}, lenition is regularly not written even when dealing with degrammaticalized lenition, while the other manuscripts start modernizing the orthography of grammatical lenition and show lenition in these instances.

\Gls{sA} and \gls{sC} do not represent lenition of \mw{g} consistently. The former nearly never does so, while the latter does so in about half the cases. In \gls{sA}, most instances of orthographical lenition comprise either an inflected form of the verb meaning `to counterswear', \eg \gls{sA} 44.28 \mw{vrhtegho}, or `be able', \eg \gls{sA} 45.34 \mw{eill}. In \gls{sC} we see that words of the type /gw̯\gls{C}/ seldomly lenite, just like in some translations of the \mw{Brut} \todo{refer to section.}. These observations on both manuscripts fall short of full explanations for the distribution between lenited and unlenited \mw{g}, but they nevertheless offer a valuable insight. The fact that these two orthographically conservative manuscripts both fail to lenite \mw{g} demonstrates that the ur-exemplar\todo{Spelling? better term?} of the tractate on suretyship did not write lenition of \mw{g}. This is obscured by the high degree of success with which other manuscripts modernized the spelling of lenited \mw{g}, and leaves one to wonder why this modernization was done so much more successfully in the case of \mw{g} than in the case of \mw{p, t, c}.

No manuscript writes lenition of \mw{b} in more than about four-fifths of the instances where it could. However, more than half of these instances involve inflections of \mw[to be]{bot} following the negative particle \mw{ny, na} or compound containing the same particle: \mw{ony}. This merely sporadic lenition of \mw{bod} following the negative particle is still found in present-day Welsh \autocite[695]{thomas_gramadeg_1996}. Failure to lenite following \mw{ny} is also found with other verbs starting with \mw{b}, and with verbs starting with \mw{m}. Lack of orthographical lenition may mirror lack of phonemic lenition in this specific context, and this pattern is therefore irrelevant to the topic of the orthography of lenition.

\section{Chronology and the laws}
\label{sec:chronology-laws}


How well do these percentages correspond to the date of composition of the manuscript? The hypothesis is that a law manuscript's orthography should be more conservative than that of a contemporary manuscript containing the \mw{Brut}, because the former would be a copy of an older Welsh-language exemplar, and the latter would be a roughly contemporaneous translation.

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sA} \& \gls{sC}}
\label{sec:glsa--glsc}


Purely based on whether lenition of voiceless stops was written. \gls{sA} and \gls{sC} stand out as the most archaic. Neither of these manuscripts writes lenition of \mw{p, t c} aside from a handful of instances. This handful of instances is always found in \gls{sA}, and is found in Table~\ref{tab:lenptcsa}. 

\begin{table}[h]

    \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}%
\caption{Instances of orthographical lenition of voiceless stops in \gls{sA}.}
  \label{tab:lenptcsa}
\end{table}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sB}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssb}


The next most archaic-looking orthography of lenited voiceless stops is found in \gls{sB}, where \mw{t} is never lenited, and \mw{p} and \mw{c} are lenited sporadically. This distribution is puzzling, as it conforms to no pattern found in Chapter~\todo{Brut \& also Taliesin}. There, we witnessed an intermediate period in the development of orthographical lenition of \mw{p, t, c} where \mw{p, t} were not lenited, but where \mw{c} was. Table~\ref{tab:lenpsbexre} shows that there is no obvious pattern, and a word such as \mw[thing]{peth} is found both lenited and unlenited in the same grammatical contexts.

  \caption{Lenition of \mw{p} in \gls{sB}, excluding research exceptions.}
  \label{tab:lenpsbexre}%
\end{table}%


So what historical context could have induced the scribe of \gls{sB} to add orthographical lenition of \mw{p}, but only in half the cases, and not for \mw{c, t}? \Gls{sB} dates from the second half of the thirteenth century. This is exactly the period when orthographical lenition of \mw{c} became commonplace, but not yet \mw{p, t}.\todo{Unsolved issue}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sG}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssg}

The next most ancient-looking orthography of lenited voiceless stops is found in \gls{sG}. Different voiceless stops are all represented to a similar degree, but only about a quarter to a third of lenited \mw{p, t, c} are represented as such. This begs the question whether there is any way to account for the distribution of represented and unrepresented lenition. Some regularities may be found. Scribal abbreviations such as the one given in Example~\ref{abbrsg} never show lenition, perhaps because writing lenition here would make abbreviation unrecognizable.
\mwcc[abbrsg]{\gls{sG} 22v.11}{O d\abbr{eruyd}. y wreic rodi bri duỽ ar peth a'e wadu yn \al{k\abbr{yfreith}aỽl}}{If a woman happens to give an oath and to deny it lawfully}
Also, most instances of \mw[his]{y} are followed by orthographical lenition, perhaps in order to disambiguate this pronoun from the article.

Otherwise, lenition is quite haphazardly represented, and the same grammatical context may show orthographical lenition in one instance, but not in the next. No frequently-occurring grammatical context always has lenition, or never has it. This is significant in itself, because it demonstrates that the scribe of \gls{sG} had the ability to insert lenition, but that it had a low priority for him. He would never do so where it could render an abbreviation illegible, and he would do so more frequently only where lenition could serve to make meanings clearer.

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sE}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glsse}

In \gls{sE}, lenition of \gls{T} is written more frequently than in \gls{sG}, even though \gls{sE} is dated from the latter half of the thirteenth century while \gls{sG} is dated from the beginning of the fourteenth century. The orthography of lenition therefore makes this manuscript look younger. Still, a clue exists as to \gls{sE}'s earlier date: lenition of \mw{c} is written  more frequently than that of \mw{t}. It is typical of late thirteenth-century orthography to write lenition of \mw{c}, but not \mw{p} and \mw{t}. \todo{what about \mw{p}?}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sD}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssd}

Lenition in \gls{sD} looks the youngest, and indeed the manuscript dates from as late as the early fifteenth century. The reason \gls{sD} looks so much younger than the other manuscripts is not only that it writes lenition with a fairly high frequency, but also that this frequency is similar for \mw{p}, \mw{t}, and \mw{c}. If the total percentage of representation of \lT\ were similar, but much higher for \mw{c} than for \mw{p, t}, then this would have implicated an earlier date for \gls{sD}. Remaining instances of non-represented lenition include scribal abbreviations similar to the one found in  Example~\ref{abbrsg}, and instances where  \mw[would be]{bei} may be considered either a verb or a conjunction. Lenition following an elided verbal particle \mw{a} would be expected in the former case, but not in the latter. An instance of this is given in Example~\ref{peisd}.
\mwcc[peisd]{\gls{sD} 29.16--17}{ef a dyly y gymheỻ ual y kymheỻei y mach \al{pei} byỽ.}{He is entitled to compel as he would compel the surety if he were alive.}

\section{Stemmatics and the laws}
\label{sec:stemmatics-laws}


How well do these percentages showing the prevalence of orthographical lenition mirror the stemmatic relationship between the manuscripts proposed in Figure~\ref{fig:suretyshstemma2} and Figure~\ref{fig:stemmalawc}? Both stemmata propose a close relationship between \gls{sA} and \gls{sE}, and another grouping of \gls{sB}, \gls{sD}, and \gls{sG}. Is this relationship visible in the patterns of lenition? Can any specific additions of orthographical lenition be connected to hypothetical nodes on either stemma?
