\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

In this chapter, I analyze where lenition was represented in the various law texts.
The laws have existed in a written form since at least the early thirteenth century, and continued to be copied throughout the remainder of the Middle Welsh period. Taken together, these facts mean that the law texts lend themselves to investigation into how scribes copied manuscripts and when they maintained or changed the non-representation of lenited voiceless stops.

Lenition of voiceless stops was represented orthographically by the mid-fourteenth century, so manuscripts from around this period are most useful to chart this change in orthography.
Earlier manuscripts serve to demonstrate that the law texts indeed saw a period in which lenition of voiceless stops was not represented, even though lenition of other consonants was.
Later manuscripts may still show traces of the early orthography, allowing me to identify specific environments within which non-representation of lenited voiceless stops may be preserved.
I focus on the transmission of \mw{Llyfr Iorwerth}, because most of the oldest law manuscripts contain this law text, while there are still some newer ones.
 
Wiliam notes the following about the extant manuscripts:
\tqt{{[N]}o MS.\ of those now extant can be regarded as the original Book of Iorwerth, for none of them is such that the others may reasonably be held to be derived from it. Nevertheless, it is probable that all of the Venedotian MSS.\ were copied directly or indirectly from a common archetype of the class, for there is too much similarity between them to allow a belief in their independent origin.}{wiliam_llyfr_1960}{xxi}
The fact that all extant manuscripts go back to one single written source well before orthographical lenition of voiceless stops means that we may safely assume that all instances of orthographically lenited voiceless stops found in these manuscripts are the result of scribal innovation arising from copying this text. 

% How are various manuscripts related to each other?
% It is nowadays thought that none of the earliest extant manuscripts is a direct ancestor of another extant copy.
% One author who did think this was J.\ Gwenogvryn Evans (Figure~\ref{fig:gwevanslli}).
% Rather, extant manuscripts are held to have common exemplars that no longer exist.
% Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} gives a stemma for the Iorwerth manuscripts (and some more manuscripts), and I will use this stemma as a point of departure for my own research.

% Which manuscripts may be used for analysis?
% One useful manuscript is \textit{A}, the \gls{bbch}, dating from around 1250. This manuscript is one of the oldest law manuscripts, and its orthography is very unusual.
% Another useful manuscript is \textit{B}, which is also fairly old, and dates from the end of the thirteenth century.
% Other thirteenth-century manuscripts shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb}: \textit{EC};
% early fourteenth century: \textit{G};
% other manuscripts in this stemma are all later than the fourteenth century.
% Some more useful manuscripts are: \textit{VW}, by scribe X86; \textit{Tr}, by Gwilym Was Da.

% What sections of the law texts are useful for analysis?
% Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} shows that \textit{B} was  transmitted in part from several sources. This makes both the Test Book and the Laws of Country interesting targets for analysis, as the orthography of lenition may confirm or deny this peculiar reconstruction by Charles-Edwards.
% Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} also shows that different parts of the Test Book may have been added in intermediate stages between Redaction I and the extant manuscripts.
% Comparison of these chunks with text found in all the manuscripts may prove useful in establishing at what point in time these chunks were added, and therefore when some of the hypothetical nodes in the stemma were written.

% \subsection{The law corpus}
% \label{sec:fleshed-out-research}
I will take a part of the tractate on suretyship for analysis.
This tractate is found in many manuscripts from the Iorwerth tradition, and those manuscripts vary in date from the mid-thirteenth century to 1404.
To be more specific, I will use \textcite[\S\S58--65]{wiliam_llyfr_1960} for analysis.

The tractate of suretyship is particularly suitable for analysis because it constitutes an archaic core of the Iorwerth law tradition, and may therefore safely be assumed to have had a textual form well before the dates of the first manuscripts --- the mid-thirteenth century\footnote{Compare, for instance \S101 on suretyship, which \textcite[20]{stacey_archaic_1986} describes the Iorwerth version as preserving the most primitive version.}. We may consequently be fairly certain that lenition of voiceless stops was not represented orthographically in the latest shared ancestor of all extant manuscripts.

\section{On the manuscripts}
\label{sec:manuscripts}
I have taken eight manuscripts for analysis. I will discuss them here. I refer to these manuscripts using their manuscript sigla throughout the chapter\footnote{These manuscript sigla were coined by \textcite{owen_ancient_1841}.}.

The manuscript with the siglum \gls{sA} is  \gls{nlw}, Peniarth MS 29, also known as the Black Book of Chirk. It is dated to the mid-thirteenth century and thought to have been produced in the Arfon region~\autocite[171]{russell_scribal_1995}.  Several scribes may be identified in the manuscript, but the material used here all comes from Hand D and a few lines by Hand E~\autocite[133--134]{russell_scribal_1995}. Hand D's orthography is peculiar for the thirteenth century in that he writes /ə/ with \mw[]{a}, and he has many variant spellings for /θ/, such as \mw[]{s, h, sh, ht, sth}. Hand E's work seems to be `the most regular and consistent of all scribes in [\gls{sA}]'~\autocite[152]{russell_scribal_1995}. The irregular spelling of dental fricatives, along with some other orthographical irregularities, suggests that \gls{sA}'s exemplar was written in \gls{ow} orthography~\autocite[169]{russell_scribal_1995}. 

Manuscript \gls{sB} is also known as \gls{bl}, Cotton Titus D.~ii, and belongs to the late thirteenth century, and may have been produced in St Asaph~\autocite[v]{elias_golygiad_2007}. The orthography of \gls{sB} is more consistent than that of \gls{sA}. \Textcite[xlii]{wiliam_llyfr_1960} notes about the orthography that `[m]utations of initial consonants are sometimes indicated, sometimes not. The nasal mutation, however, is regularly shown'.

Manuscript \gls{sC} is known more fully as \gls{bl}, Cotton Caligula A.~iii, and may be dated to the mid-thirteenth century. Its scribe was the same scribe as the one of the \gls{ll1} and \gls{p44} manuscripts, both containing the \mw[]{Brut y Brenhinedd}. \Textcite[189]{huws_medieval_2000} argues that the manuscript was probably written in a monastic milieu in north-east Wales. He considers Valle Crucis in Denbighshire to be the most likely place of composition.

Manuscript \gls{sD} is also known as \gls{nlw} Peniarth MS 32, and as \mow[]{Y Llyfr Teg}. It was produced around 1404~\autocite[60]{huws_medieval_2000} in the Cwm Tawe area~\autocite[v]{elias_golygiad_2007}. The laws texts are all written by Scribe X91, who is described as writing with great regularity and legibility, and his orthography mostly conforms to what was expected of this period~\autocite{thomas_tei_???}.

Manuscript E is more fully known as \gls{bl} Additional MS 14931. It was produced at the end of the thirteenth century, and is considered a sister manuscript to \gls{sA}. An addition was written near the end in the hand of \gls{sB}. These facts give a geographic connection either to Arfon or to St Asaph~\autocite[100]{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}.

Manuscript \gls{sG} is \gls{nlw} Peniarth MS 35. It is written in the early fourteenth century by a scribe identified by Daniel Huws as X87, in whose hand we also find a copy of the laws of the Cyfnerth group from South Wales~\autocite{smith_tei_???}. It was probably produced in the Brycheiniog area~\autocite[v]{elias_golygiad_2007}. It is the first manuscript from the Iorwerth tradition with a southern provenance~\autocite{charles-edwards_texts:_1986}.

Manuscript \gls{sJ} is Oxford, Jesus College MS 57, and was written around 1400 by Hywel Vychan of Builth, who was also the principal scribe of the Red Book of Hergest~\autocite[100]{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}. The manuscript may be connected to the Cwm Tawe area~\autocite{james_llwyr_1993}.

Manuscript \gls{sK} is also known as \gls{nlw} Peniarth MS 40 or as \mw{Llyfr Calan}, and is written after 1469 by Lewis Glyn Cothi~\autocite{roberts_cyfraith_2011}. It contains four poems in the beginning addressed to the lord of Cefn Llys, suggesting that the manuscript was written in this area~\autocite[374]{evans_report_1899}.

The paragraphs selected for analysis correspond to the folio numbers, column numbers and line numbers in the manuscripts given in Table~\ref{tab:surety}. This text runs continuously in all of these manuscripts, except in \gls{sG}, where it is interspersed with other additions. Over 200 data points were taken from each manuscript for analysis, except for \gls{sJ}, which has shortened the tractate on suretyship considerably.

\subsection{The geographical spread of the manuscripts}
\label{sec:geogr-spre-manuscr}

The places where the manuscripts are presumed to have been produced are given in Figure~\ref{fig:mslocs}. The geographic origin of a manuscript tends to be less certain than its date. This means that the locations on the map may be taken with a grain of salt. Still, it is reasonable that these localisations are not off by an order of magnitude, and that we may somewhat confidently classify the manuscripts geographically into two groups. The first group is found in North Wales, and comprises \gls{sA}\gls{sB}\gls{sC}\gls{sE}. All of these manuscripts may be dated to the thirteenth century. The second group is found in South Wales, and comprises \gls{sD}\gls{sG}\gls{sJ}\gls{sK}. These manuscripts are all from the fourteenth and fifteenth century.

  \label{fig:mslocs}
\end{figure}



Because the geographical split and temporal split occurs along the same lines, it is difficult to separate whether the different patterns of lenition found in these manuscripts are due to their temporal distance or due to their geographical distance.\todo{This comment is more suitable as a concluding remark, perhaps.}



\section{The stemmatic relationship of the manuscripts}
\label{sec:stemmata}
Here, I discuss the literature on how the manuscripts are related.

\section{Some preliminary observations}
\label{sec:some-prel-observ}

\gls{sB}, folio 42v, \S 104 has the following as the preface of the Test Book:
\mwcc[preftestb]{\gls{sB} 42v.18--20}{Llyma e dechreu e Llyuer Prauf. Sef yu henne, teyr colouen keureyth guerth guyllt a dof ac a perthyn arnadunt.}{Here starts the Test Book. That is, three columns of law of wild and tame value, and what relates to them.}
Figure~\ref{fig:stemmatestb} shows that the preface to the Test Book was added as late as Redaction II.
This one line shown in Example~\ref{preftestb} shows lenition word-internally, and there are two examples  where word-initial lenition may be expected:, \mw[columns of law]{colouen keureyth}, with lenition following a feminine noun, and \mw[that relates]{a perthyn}, with lenition following the verbal particle.
As lenition  is not written here, we may assume that Redaction II was composed before lenition of voiceless stops was written.
This is unsurprising, as one of its manuscripts, \textit{C}, is dated as early as 1250.
This somewhat trivial example serves to demonstrate how combined knowledge of when which parts were added in a stemma and of the orthography of lenition may help to date hypothetical nodes in a stemma. 


\section{How do manuscripts modernize?}
\label{sec:how-do-manuscripts}

How is lenition modernized in the later manuscripts compared to the older ones?
The most obvious way of course is by simply writing lenition where no lenition was written previously. Such innovations are easily covered by simply checking to what extent each manuscript writes lenition where it should. However, there is also a more insidious way of adjusting older orthographies to newer standards.

When older manuscripts have an element that causes lenition followed by a word starting with a voiceless stop, lenition is typically not written. Later recensions sometimes solve this outdated orthographical convention by simply deleting the element causing lenition. This is found when comparing \gls{sD} with some of its older cousins:
\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:ekyfreithb]{\gls{sB} 20v.24}{sef a wyl \al{e keureyth} ena}{This is how the law sees it}
  \mwc[ex:ekyfreithd]{\gls{sD} 54.3}{Sef a wyl \al{kyfreith} yna}{This is how [the] law sees it}
  \mwc[ex:ekyfreithk]{\gls{sK} 70.6}{Sef a ỽyl .k.\ yna}{This is how [the] law sees it}
  \mwc[ex:ykeinhawcb]{\gls{sB} 21v.22--24}{ny dyweyt \al{e keureyth} deleu ohanau trae keuen namen dymey canys dymey yu traean \al{e keynnyauc} keureyth.}{The  law does not say that he is  entitled, except to a halfpenny back, because that is a third of the penny of law.}
  \mwc[ex:ykeinhawcd]{\gls{sD} 56.19--21}{Ny dyweit.\ \al{k\abbr{yfreith}.}\ dylyu ohonaỽ drachefyn namyn dimei. kanys hynny yỽ traean \al{keinhaỽc} k\abbr{yfreith}.}{{[}The] law does not say that he is  entitled, except to a halfpenny back, because that is a third of [the] penny of law.}
\mwc[]{\gls{sD} 56.16--18}{O chanhatta y kynnogyn yr mach rodi gỽystyl punt yn ỻe \al{un} geinyaỽc}{}
\mwc[]{\gls{sK} 72.22--23}{O chanhiatta y kynogyn ir mach rodi gỽystyl punt yn lle k\abbr{einiawc}.}{}
\mwc[]{\gls{sD} 58.4}{OS o uechni y dewis; nyt oes gynnogyn.}{}
\mwc[]{\gls{sK} 74.15--16}{Os o uechni i deỽis i ardelỽ.\ it oes ardelỽ kynogyn.}{This example shows words may not only be removed, but also added in order to make sense of a non-mutation.}
\end{mwl}
Examples~\ref{ex:ekyfreithb} and \ref{ex:ykeinhawcb} show the more archaic wording in \gls{sB}, shared with most other manuscripts. The lack of definite articles in Examples~\ref{ex:ekyfreithd} and \ref{ex:ykeinhawcd} makes for awkward sentences in both cases. These awkward sentences are evidence that \gls{sD} had an exemplar containing lack of orthographical lenition following the article, as they would not be found if the text in \gls{sD} were as old as its manuscript.

The way the scribe of \gls{sD} adapted an older orthographical stratum by simply deleting these leniting elements is particularly insidious because it does not show up in the statistics. There is, after all, no instance of non-lenition where we would expect lenition.

I wonder to what extent this tool of uncovering an older orthographical stratum is useful in general when determining that an old text in a new manuscript is indeed old. Comparing \gls{sD} with its cousins makes it obvious how its scribe modernized by removing the article, but it is only obvious because its cousins are there in the first place. Would it be possible to diagnose the removal of a feminine article or some other element causing lenition in a late \gls{mw} manuscript, and then safely conclude that it had an early exemplar in the absence of a thirteenth-century manuscript to compare it with? It would be highly trivial to demonstrate a text has a thirteenth-century orthographical stratum, if one can only do so by comparing it with a text found in the thirteenth century.
\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Tables~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryincre} and~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryexcre} show to what degree lenition was represented in the tractate on suretyship in various recensions of the book of Iorwerth. One obvious difference between the results shown in this table and what we see in the Brut\footnote{See Tables~\ref{tab:perlenbrut} and \ref{tab:perlenbrutex}.} is that even in the latest recensions, full consistency in writing  lenition of \mw{p, t, c} is not achieved. The latest manuscript, \gls{sD} written about 1404, still only writes lenition where it should in about three-quarters of the cases.

Another difference is found specifically by comparing the numbers between both Table~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryincre} as well as Table~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryexcre}, and concerns research exceptions, \ie instances where lenition was not synchronically morphophonemic, such as \mw[with]{gan}, or \mw[\mbox{-ever}]{bynnac}. The orthography of lenition in these exceptions only differs from `proper' lenition when the initial consonant is a voiceless stop. This means that degrammaticalized lenition of voiceless stops was written early on, but not grammatical lenition. The greatest differences between these percentages is found in \gls{sB}, because this manuscript both fails to write morphophonemic lenition and starts writing words like \mw[with]{gan} with a lenited grapheme. In \gls{sA}, and to a lesser degree \gls{sC}, lenition is regularly not written even when dealing with degrammaticalized lenition, while the other manuscripts start modernizing the orthography of grammatical lenition and show lenition in these instances.

\Gls{sA} and \gls{sC} do not represent lenition of \mw{g} consistently. The former hardly ever does so, while the latter does so in about half the cases. In \gls{sA}, most instances of orthographical lenition comprise either an inflected form of the verb meaning `to counterswear', \eg \gls{sA} 44.28 \mw{vrhtegho}, or `be able', \eg \gls{sA} 45.34 \mw{eill}. In \gls{sC} we see that words of the type /gw̯\gls{C}/ seldom lenite, just like in some translations of the \mw{Brut}\footnote{See Section~\ref{sec:lenited-mwg}}. These observations on both manuscripts fall short of full explanations for the distribution between lenited and unlenited \mw{g}, but they nevertheless offer a valuable insight. The fact that these two orthographically conservative manuscripts both fail to lenite \mw{g} demonstrates that the ur-exemplar\todo{Spelling? better term?} of the tractate on suretyship did not write lenition of \mw{g}. This is obscured by the high degree of success with which other manuscripts modernized the spelling of lenited \mw{g}, and leaves one to wonder why this modernization was done so much more successfully in the case of \mw{g} than in the case of \mw{p, t, c}.

No manuscript writes lenition of \mw{b} in more than about four-fifths of the instances where it could. However, more than half of these instances involve inflections of \mw[to be]{bot} following the negative particle \mw{ny, na} or compound containing the same particle: \mw{ony}. This merely sporadic lenition of \mw{bod} following the negative particle is still found in present-day Welsh \autocite[695]{thomas_gramadeg_1996}. Failure to lenite following \mw{ny} is also found with other verbs starting with \mw{b}, and with verbs starting with \mw{m}. Lack of orthographical lenition may mirror lack of phonemic lenition in this specific context, and this pattern is therefore irrelevant to the topic of the orthography of lenition.

\section{Chronology and the laws}
\label{sec:chronology-laws}

This section discusses how well the percentages given in Table~\ref{tab:lenlawcountryexcre} correspond to the date of composition of the manuscript. The hypothesis is that a law manuscript's orthography will be more conservative than that of a contemporary manuscript containing the \mw{Brut}, because the former would be a copy of an older Welsh-language exemplar, and the latter would be a roughly contemporaneous translation.

The earliest two manuscripts are mid-thirteenth-century \gls{sA} and \gls{sC}. As expected, they do not write lenition of voiceless stops, because this orthographical innovation had not taken place yet. These manuscripts show the same pattern as a contemporary original composition would.

The second earliest manuscripts are late-thirteenth-century \gls{sB} and \gls{sE}. These two manuscripts differ from each other in terms of how frequently lenition is inserted, but have in common that orthographical lenition of \mw[]{t} is less common than the other two voiceless stops. Manuscript \gls{sE} has percentually more lenition represented for \mw[]{p, t} than any other manuscript studied here; even than its later cousins. This makes sense if we consider that scribes would be more conscious of a new spelling convention shortly after it was invented. They would consequently be more zealous in applying it to their copies than those of a few generations later, when nobody considered the orthography of lenited voiceless stops problematic anymore. Still, this does not explain the wildly differing rates of orthographical lenition between \gls{sB} and \gls{sE}. Perhaps this also depended on the individual scribe, or place of composition \todo{Find out about geography}.

This line of reasoning explains why the next oldest manuscript \gls{sG}, had a lower rate of orthographical representation of lenition. By this point, \mw[]{p, t, c} are represented in roughly equal measure, because the orthographical innovation was complete.

Similarly, in \gls{sD}, lenition occurred in even measure for all consonants. This again implies that orthographical lenition was added well after the end of the thirteenth century. 

In \gls{sK}, lenition was written less frequently for \mw[]{t}. Given how this manuscript dates from the late fifteenth century, this is obviously not a sign of its times. It rather implies that some amount of lenition was added to a direct ancestor in the late thirteenth century, and that this pattern was not updated by the scribe of \gls{sK}. We may envisage two motivations for the inertia shown by \gls{sK}'s scribe. One is that the orthography of \lT\ was no longer considered a contemporary topic, so there is no reason for him to have any suspicions on this front. The second motivation could be that some amount of orthographical lenition was already there, so he could consider the work having been done already. 

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sA} \& \gls{sC}}
\label{sec:glsa--glsc}


Purely based on whether lenition of voiceless stops was written. \gls{sA} and \gls{sC} stand out as the most archaic. Neither of these manuscripts writes lenition of \mw{p, t c} aside from a handful of instances. This handful of instances is always found in \gls{sA}, and is presented in Table~\ref{tab:lenptcsa}.

Orthographic lenition of \mw[whose \ldots\ is]{bieu} may be indicative that this verb was petrified here. Lenition here would be due to verbal particle \mw[]{a}, but this particle is not in fact expressed. Also, \mw[]{bieu} is an irregular inflection. Most irregular inflections are forms with \mw[to be]{bod}, so there is grounds for \mw[whose \ldots\ is]{[a]\gls{l} bieu} to be reanalysed as starting with a radical \mw[]{b} rather than a lenited \mw[]{p}.

\end{table}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sB}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssb}


The next most archaic-looking orthography of lenited voiceless stops is found in \gls{sB}, where \mw{t} is never lenited, and \mw{p} and \mw{c} are lenited sporadically. This distribution is puzzling, as it conforms to no pattern found in Chapter~\ref{cha:indep-comp-mwbr}\todo{\& also Taliesin}. There, we witnessed an intermediate period in the development of orthographical lenition of \mw{p, t, c} where \mw{p, t} were not lenited, but where \mw{c} was. Table~\ref{tab:lenpsbexre} shows that there is no obvious pattern, and a word such as \mw[thing]{peth} is found both lenited and unlenited in the same grammatical contexts.

\begin{table}[h]

  \begin{tabular}{ddwql}

    \tch{Folio} & \tch{Line} & \tch{Word} & \tch{Translation} & \tch{Reason} \\

    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}%
  \caption{Lenition of \mw{p} in \gls{sB}, excluding research exceptions.}
  \label{tab:lenpsbexre}%
\end{table}%


So what historical context could have induced the scribe of \gls{sB} to add orthographical lenition of \mw{p}, but only in half the cases, and not for \mw{c, t}? \Gls{sB} dates from the second half of the thirteenth century. This is exactly the period when orthographical lenition of \mw{c} became commonplace, but not yet \mw{p, t}.\todo{Unsolved issue}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sG}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssg}

The next most ancient-looking orthography of lenited voiceless stops is found in \gls{sG}. Different voiceless stops are all represented to a similar degree, but only about a quarter to a third of lenited \mw{p, t, c} are represented as such. This begs the question whether there is any way to account for the distribution of represented and unrepresented lenition. Some regularities may be found. Scribal abbreviations such as the one given in Example~\ref{abbrsg} never show lenition, perhaps because writing lenition here would make abbreviation unrecognizable.
\mwcc[abbrsg]{\gls{sG} 22v.11}{O d\abbr{eruyd}. y wreic rodi bri duỽ ar peth a'e wadu yn \al{k\abbr{yfreith}aỽl}}{If a woman happens to give an oath and to deny it lawfully}
Also, most instances of \mw[his]{y} are followed by orthographical lenition, perhaps in order to disambiguate this pronoun from the article.

Otherwise, lenition is quite haphazardly represented, and the same grammatical context may show orthographical lenition in one instance, but not in the next. No frequently-occurring grammatical context always has lenition, or never has it. This is significant in itself, because it demonstrates that the scribe of \gls{sG} had the ability to insert lenition, but that it had a low priority for him. He would never do so where it could render an abbreviation unintelligible, and he would do so more frequently only where lenition could serve to make meanings clearer.

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sE}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glsse}

In \gls{sE}, lenition of \gls{T} is written more frequently than in \gls{sG}, even though \gls{sE} is dated from the latter half of the thirteenth century while \gls{sG} is dated from the beginning of the fourteenth century. The orthography of lenition therefore makes this manuscript look younger. Still, a clue exists as to \gls{sE}'s earlier date: lenition of \mw{c} is written  more frequently than that of \mw{t}. It is typical of late thirteenth-century orthography to write lenition of \mw{c}, but not \mw{p} and \mw{t}. \todo{what about \mw{p}?}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sD}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssd}

Lenition in \gls{sD} looks the youngest, and indeed the manuscript dates from as late as the early fifteenth century. The reason \gls{sD} looks so much younger than the other manuscripts is not only that it writes lenition with a fairly high frequency, but also that this frequency is similar for \mw{p}, \mw{t}, and \mw{c}. If the total percentage of representation of \lT\ were similar, but much higher for \mw{c} than for \mw{p, t}, then this would have implied an earlier date for \gls{sD}. Remaining instances of non-represented lenition include scribal abbreviations similar to the one found in  Example~\ref{abbrsg}, and instances where  \mw[would be]{bei} may be considered either a verb or a conjunction. Lenition following an elided verbal particle \mw{a} would be expected in the former case, but not in the latter. An instance of this is given in Example~\ref{peisd}.
\mwcc[peisd]{\gls{sD} 29.16--17}{ef a dyly y gymheỻ ual y kymheỻei y mach \al{pei} byỽ.}{He is entitled to compel him as he would compel the surety if he were alive.}

\subsection{The apparent age of \gls{sK}}
\label{sec:apparent-age-glssk}

\gls{sK} looks innovative and conservative at the same time. It tends not to add lenition to voiceless stops wherever lenition was obviously spoken in the earlier period \eg after \mw[on]{ar}. At the same time, however, the scribe of \gls{sK} changed many sentences by removing the element causing lenition, or by adding a word between the element causing lenition and the word to be lenited otherwise.

  It also adds many innovative instances of lenition, \ie object lenition, lenition of the nominal predicate and parenthesis. The implication is that the grammar of the scribe was indeed as new as the fifteenth century, but that his exemplar was very archaic indeed. Perhaps more so than D.

  Another reason besides simply comparing lenition of voiceless stops as a whole makes one think \gls{sK}'s exemplar was more archaic than D's exemplar: orthographical lenition is more frequently expressed for \mw[]{c} than for \mw[]{p} and \mw[]{t}. Because this pattern is otherwise only found in manuscripts from the late thirteenth and early fourteenth century, it implies that \gls{sK} had an intermediate exemplar from this period.

\section{Stemmatics and the laws}
\label{sec:stemmatics-laws}


How well do these percentages showing the prevalence of orthographical lenition mirror the stemmatic relationship between the manuscripts proposed in Figure~\ref{fig:suretyshstemma2} and Figure~\ref{fig:stemmalawc}? Both stemmata propose a close relationship between \gls{sA} and \gls{sE}, and another grouping of \gls{sB}, \gls{sD}, and \gls{sG}. Is the grouping of \gls{sA}\gls{sE} and \gls{sB}\gls{sD}\gls{sG}\ visible in the patterns of lenition? Can any specific additions of orthographical lenition be connected to hypothetical nodes on either stemma?

The differences between these two stemmata concern the position of \gls{sC}, and whether \gls{sG} has a closer relationship with \gls{sB}, or with \gls{sD}. How closely does lenition in \gls{sC} pattern with \gls{sB}\gls{sD}\gls{sG} on the one hand, and with \gls{sA}\gls{sE} on the other hand?

\subsection{The two groups}
\label{sec:two-groups}
Here, I discuss how the orthography of lenition may aid in deciding on the position of \gls{sC} within a stemma of manuscripts, and whether \gls{sG} has a more direct stemmatic relationship with \gls{sB}, or with \gls{sD}.

The discussion of these points allows me to introduce several methodological tools.
\subsubsection{Hypercorrection}
\label{sec:hypercorrection}


One thing \gls{sA} and \gls{sE} uniquely have in common is that they both contain one instance of unlenited \mw{ll} where we would expect lenition. These instances are given in Examples~\ref{ex:sigallw} and \ref{ex:sigellw}.
\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:sigallw]{\gls{sA} 45.14--15}{a heny vrh \al{ll}u e macht.\ kanis macht adeuedic yu.}{and that on the oath of surety, since he is an acknowledged surety.}
  \mwc[ex:sigellw]{\gls{sE} 35.32--33}{a hynny urth \al{ll}v y mach canys mach adeuedyc yu
  }{and that on the oath of surety, since he is an acknowledged surety.}
\end{mwl}


The consonant \mw{ll} is unique among all \gls{mw} consonants in that its lenited form is more archaic than its radical form in the orthography. This means that lack of orthographical lenition of \mw[]{l}--- usually a sign of archaism --- is in fact a shared innovation between \gls{sA} and \gls{sE}. I consider this type of hypercorrection a low-probability event, so it is  near-impossible that this was done separately in each manuscript.  This suggests that these two manuscripts share a common ancestor not shared by any other manuscripts studied here.

Unlike \gls{sA}\gls{sE}, \gls{sC} has a lenited consonant here, as shown in \ref{ex:sigcllw}.
\mwcc[ex:sigcllw]{\gls{sC} 157rb.14--16}{a henny wrth \al{l}w e mach. kanys mach adeỽedyc ew.}{and that on the oath of surety, since he is an acknowledged surety}
Because \gls{sC} does not pattern with \gls{sA}\gls{sE}, there is no evidence that \gls{sC} forms a group with these two manuscripts. However, it is not  evidence for grouping with the other manuscripts either, because the reading \mw{wrth lw}  found in \gls{sC} and all the other manuscripts is a shared archaism\footnote{One might argue that there is little phonetic difference between \mw[]{-th l-} and \mw[]{-th ll-}. Even if this plays a role in writing lenition of \mw[]{ll}, there would be little reason to innovate towards \mw[]{ll}, precisely because there is no difference.}. 

No other instances of hypercorrection exist that are shared between more than one mansucript.

Another instance of hypercorrection, with interpretation of a third person plural possessive pronoun as a third person singular, and subsequent lenition, and also with an instance of failing to lenite \mw{p} because \mw[on]{ar} was taken to be \mw[and]{ac}:
\mwcc[]{\gls{sK} 71.22--23}{O d\abbr{eruyd} i dyn rodi llaỽer o ueichieu a[r] peth a mynnu i ỽadu oꝛ kynogyn.}{If a man happens to take many sureties on a thing and wishes to deny them from the debtor.}

Hypercorrection of adding lenited \mw[]{g}:
\begin{mwl}
\mwc[]{\gls{sK} 77.13--14}{Ac na dyly hitheu raith o ỽyr i \al{ỽadu} git a hi}{here \mw[her]{i} causes lenition as it meant `him'.}
\mwc[]{\gls{sD} 61.6}{ac nadyly hitheu reith o wyr y gỽadu hi.}{}
\end{mwl}
\subsubsection{Object lenition}
\label{sec:object-lenition}

Object lenition is a type of free lenition not applied consistently in Middle Welsh, especially not in its earlier stages. Unlike the matter of the voiceless stops, lenition or non-lenition of the grammatical object is not simply a matter of orthography, but rather reflects spoken free variation.

Consider object lenition of \mw[that \dots\ is]{bot} in Examples~\ref{ex:sbbot}, \ref{ex:scbot}, and \ref{ex:sdbot} below:

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[ex:sbbot]{\gls{sB} 21r.14--16}{ac os negyd uyd e kennogen ydau deuet ar e uach a holet e uach a dywedet \al{bot} e kynnogen en negyd ydau. }{And if the debtor will be a refuser to him, he must come to the surety and must claim to the surety and must say that the debtor is a refuser.}
  \mwc[ex:scbot]{\gls{sC} 156vb.18--23}{ac os negyf ỽyd e kynnogyn ydaw; deỽet ar y ỽach a holet y ỽach. a dywedet \al{ỽot} e kynnogyn en negyf ydaỽ.}{And if the debtor will be a refuser to him, he must come to the surety and must claim to the surety and must say that the debtor is a refuser.}
  \mwc[ex:sdbot]{\gls{sD} 54.26--55.3}{ac os negyf vyd y kynnogyn idaỽ; deuet ar y vach a holet y uach. a dywedet \al{vot} y kynnogyn yn negyf idaỽ.}{And if the debtor will be a refuser to him, he must come to the surety and must claim to the surety and must say that the debtor is a refuser.}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sK} 71.4--6}{ac os negyd uyd y kynnogyn ido. deuet ar i uach a dyỽetet \al{uot} y kynnogyn yn negyd ido.}{}

\end{mwl}

Manuscript \gls{sC} patterns with \gls{sD} in this regard. This is a shared innovation that does not necessarily occur everywhere, so lenition of \mw[]{bot} is diagnostic of \gls{sC} and \gls{sD} sharing a stemmatic node not shared with \gls{sB}. This innovation could occur independently, so using object lenition to demonstrate shared innovations is best served by having several examples at hand.

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sK} 77.7--9}{ac ỽꝛth naill y mach \al{gynnal} ẏ uechni ir aeth yn uach arnei i gelỽir un oueruach}{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sD} 60.25--26}{ac ỽrth na eiỻ y mach \al{kynnal} y vechni yd aeth yn vach arnei y gelwir yn oueruach.}{}
\end{mwl}

\subsubsection{NP lenition}
\label{sec:np-lenition}

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sA} 47.19}{kan  bu guell kanthau ef uunet...}{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sB} 23r.7--8}{a  chan bu well ganthau ef menet}{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sC} 160ra.10--12}{kan bw gwell kanthaw ef mynet...}{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sD} 59.24--25}{kann bu weỻ ganthaỽ vynet...}{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sE} 38.14}{kanbu well ganthaỽ ew mynet }{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sK} 76.6--7 \S 64.12}{kan bu ỽell gando mynet...}{}
\end{mwl}

\subsubsection{Adverb lenition}
\label{sec:adverb-lenition}

\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sK} 73.1--2}{Ni dyỽeit y .k\abbr{yfreith}.\ dylyu ohonaỽ trachefyn namyn dimai}{}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sD} 56.19--20}{Ny dyweit.\ kyfreith.\ dylyu ohonaỽ drachefyn namyn dimei.}{}
\end{mwl}
This makes \gls{sK} orthographically more conservative than the percentages suggest.

\subsubsection{variable gender}
\label{sec:variable-gender}

\begin{mwl}
\mwc[]{B 20v.27--29}{ac esef nesset e deleant bot ydau e guyr henne mal e delehoent talu galanas e gyt ac ef ae chemryt.}{}
\mwc[]{\gls{sK} 70.11-12 \S 60.3}{yn gyneſſet ac u dlyỽynt talu galanas git ac ef ai \al{gymryt}}{as close as if they would have to pay wergild with him or to take it.}
\end{mwl}

The word \mw[wergild]{galanas} is masculine in \gls{sK}, but feminine in \gls{sD}.

Another noun with a variable gender  is found in  \mw[loss]{colled}, from \S 61.1:

\section{Voiceless stops}
\label{sec:voiceless-stops}
About half of the manuscripts discussed in this chapter clearly date from a period when lenited voiceless stops were represented orthographically. If these manuscripts had been newly composed, they would have been expected to  have full orthographical lenition of voiceless stops. However, every manuscript discussed in this chapter only has partial orthographical lenition of voiceless stops. This is obvious from Figure~\ref{fig:barchartlaws}, where no bar reaches 100\%. Instances of non-lenition are traces of an orthographically more archaic exemplar.

The result of this combination of factors is that every single  manuscript has some instances of orthographical representation of lenition, and some instances where lenition is not represented. Section~\ref{sec:chronology-laws} shows that there is some amount of regularity in how orthographical lenition may or may not be inserted, but also that it is to a large degree inconsistent. Example~\ref{ex:6105b} from \S 61.5 shows that neither grammatical context nor phonological context can fully account for the distribution of orthographical lenition, because the same word in the same grammatical context behaves inconsistently:
\mwcc[ex:6105b]{\gls{sB} 21r.23--27}{O  deruyd e den kemryt mach e gan arall ar \al{p}eth a dyuot e due \al{p}leyt e gyt [\dots] a dyweduet e uot en uach ar \al{b}eth bychan a hep y wadu e uechny}{If it happens that a man takes a surety by another on something and the two parties come together [\dots] and say that he is a surety on a small thing and does not deny the suretyship.}
Here, the phrase \mw[on a thing]{ar peth} is not written with lenition the first time, but it is the second time. This inconsistency adds an element of randomness to the way in which a manuscript was modernised. This random factor has value for the stemmatics of the law manuscripts. 

The data on the law manuscripts give us three key points to consider:
\begin{itemize}
\item Orthographical lenition of voiceless stops was added from the second half of the thirteenth century onwards;
\item Orthographical lenition was never added in 100\% of the instances;
\item The choice of what instances of lenition to add, and what instances not to add was to some extent random.
\end{itemize}

What this means is that anytime a manuscript dating from before the late thirteenth century was copied at the end of this century or later, a unique pattern of orthographical lenition and lack thereof was generated. This pattern would then be copied into its descendant manuscripts.

Ergo, if any two or more manuscripts share a comparable pattern of orthographical lenition --- a comparable fingerprint --- then this indicates that their last common ancestor dates from at least the second half of the thirteenth century. Conversely, if such a pattern is not found in a group of manuscripts, then this is indicative that their latest common ancestor may be dated to the first half of the thirteenth century at the latest. Studying the orthography of lenited voiceless stops therefore not only allows us to build a stemma of manuscripts, but also allows us to roughly date the nodes in such a stemma.

% Any grouping of manuscripts whose last common exemplar was at least as late as the thirteenth century may be expected to have a similar distribution of which individual words have lenition represented, and which ones do not. In other words, such an exemplar may leave a `fingerprint' of some sorts, which may allow us to diagnose stemmatic relationships, and may also allow us to date particular nodes in the stemma.

I will take the branch \Forest*{for tree={font=\itshape,
    l=2mm,l sep=0mm,s=2em,
    delay={where content={}{shape=coordinate}{}}}[γ[[\gls{sG},baseline][\gls{sD}]][[\gls{sB}][\gls{sK}]]]}
to put this methodology to the test. This branch has three nodes: the one shared between \gls{sG} and \gls{sD}, the one shared between \gls{sB} and \gls{sK}, and node \textit{γ}, which is shared between all of them. All of these manuscripts are dated to the latter half of the thirteenth century or later, so every node may be placed either before the mid-thirteenth century mark, or after it.

One useful part of the laws for this purpose is \S 61.8, which has several voiceless stops in leniting position. These were not originally written lenited, as is shown in Example~\ref{ex:6108c} from \gls{sC}:
\mwcc[ex:6108c]{\gls{sC} 167va.7--16}{O derỽyd y dyn tebygỽ bot en ryd mach oy ỽechny o talỽ peth or dylyet a hep \al{t}alw kỽbyl. e \al{k}yỽreyth a dyweyt hyt na byd a dylyw o honaw bot en ỽach ar e \al{k}eynnyaỽc dyweth. mal ar e \al{k}yntaf.}{If it happens to a man that he supposes to be a free surety of his suretyship because of the payment of his quantity of the debt without paying the whole, the law says that he will not be [free], and he must be a surety for the last penny as for the first one. }
Four of these lenitions will be discussed. These are lenitions are marked. Examples~\ref{ex:6108b}, \ref{ex:6108d}, \ref{ex:6108g}, and \ref{ex:6108k} show the different realisations of \S 61.8 in our branch. The pattern of lenition of voiceless stops already shows which manuscripts have a particularly close relationship here. Manuscripts \gls{sB} and \gls{sK} are more closely to each other than to \gls{sD}, and this can be demonstrated on the basis of the orthography of lenition alone. Example~\ref{ex:6108b} 
\begin{mwl}

\end{mwl}

Note how the words \mw[pay]{talu}, \mw[law]{cyfraith}, \mw[penny]{ceiniog}, and \mw[first]{cyntaf} all show the exact same pattern of lenition in \gls{sB} and \gls{sK}. The first three of these are not written lenited, while the last one is. This pattern is not found in either \gls{sD} or \gls{sG}. In \gls{sD} all are found lenited except \mw[]{cyfraith}, the use of which is avoided through rewording. In \gls{sG}, none of these words are written lenited, and the grammatical environment necessitating lenition is removed. 

The methodology thus indicates a close stemmatic relationship between \gls{sB} and \gls{sK}, which share a common node possibly as late as the end of the thirteenth century. This is just about possible, considering how \gls{sB} itself is dated to the latter half of the thirteenth century.

The case is different for \gls{sD} and \gls{sG}. Manuscript \gls{sD} either adds lenition or rephrases in all four cases, but this pattern cannot easily be compared to \gls{sG} which rephrases all of these lenitions. However, this rephrasing in \gls{sG} does offer a clue: \mw[until \dots\ is paid]{yny talher} has no orthographical lenition following \mw[]{yny}, implying that the rewording itself is as old as the first half of the thirteenth century\footnote{%
  One might argue that spirantization rather than lenition would be expected following \mw[]{yny}. However, spirantization was orthographically expressed from a much earlier date onwards than lenition of voiceless stops was, so lack of an orthographical mutation is more likely to indicate lenition than spirantization.}.
This implies that the latest common ancestor shared between \gls{sD} and \gls{sG} was at least as early as the mid-thirteenth century.

This conclusion does warrant some caution. The example of \S 61.8 is fairly rare in that it positively indicates a stemmatic relationship between \gls{sB} and \gls{sK}. Many other sentences either show a slight difference in which words are lenited, or they are the same but they do not contrast with other closely related manuscripts. This is not necessarily problematic. After all, every singular instance of orthographical lenition could have been added independently, and every singular archaism could be preserved across manuscripts that are not closely related. This makes every singular instance of lenition or lack thereof trivial. It is only when a large amount of tokens pattern the same way that the balance of probabilities shifts towards a scenario where orthographical lenition was added in a common ancestor, and that we may date this ancestor to at least the second half of the thirteenth century.

With these notes of caution in mind, the analysis of \S 61.8 above does not by itself provide foolproof evidence that \gls{sB} and \gls{sK} share an ancestor from the late thirteenth century, but rather provide an example of the methodology one might use to argue for such a position. The point of this chapter, after all, is not to make sweeping discoveries about how the law manuscripts are related, but to see how the orthography of lenition may aid in such an endeavour. 

I will take another part, namely \S 65.4, to further triangulate the relationship between the manuscripts:
\begin{mwl}
  \mwc[]{\gls{sB} 23r--23v.28--1}{O  deruyd er arwaessaf deweduet na dele talu namen kemeynt ac a \al{g}auas er e peth pa ryu \al{b}eth bennac uo. e \al{k}eureyth a deweyt deleu ohonau guerth keureyth e peth pa ryu \al{b}eth bennac uo}{If it happens that the warrantor says that he should not pay except as much as he got for the thing, whatever it is, the law says that he is indebted the legal value of the thing, whatever it is.}

\end{mwl}
Here, the two instances of \mw[thing]{peth} are all lenited in each manuscript\footnote{%
  The exact reason for lenition differs between \gls{sB}\gls{sG} and \gls{sD}\gls{sK}. In the former two, it is the word \mw[sort]{rhyw}, while it is \mw[what]{pa} in the latter two.}.
The word \mw[law]{cyfraith} is not written lenited in \gls{sB}\gls{sG}\gls{sK}. It is rephrased in \gls{sD}.
The word \mw[took]{cafas} is not written lenited in \gls{sG}, while it is lenited in \gls{sD}. This is evidence of a different lenition fingerprint in \gls{sG} and \gls{sD}.
