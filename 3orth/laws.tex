\tqt{One advantage which Welsh law enjoyed in the political storms of the thirteenth century was that it had a written form. Already in the twelfth century it was felt to be an embarassment if law remained unwritten. Roman law was embodied in texts, and with the great legal revival of the eleventh and twelfth centuries it was felt that any law worthy of the name should be written.

\tqt{Welsh law survives in many complete manuscripts and fragments of others. The difficulty scholars have had in coping with this wealth of material stems from two opposite truths: first, each manuscript is an individual entity in that no one manuscript presents a text exactly the same as any other; but, secondly, the manuscripts fall into groups because they share, to a greater or lesser extent, the same content. As a result there have been long terminological travails attempting to give due weight both to the variations between manuscripts and also the links between them.
}{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}{17}


\tqt{The considerable differences between the law books show that their authors were not concerned, like the Irish, to preserve intact a standard text handed down from the past.
  Linguistically, the laws are not unlike many Middle Welsh prose tales: in spite of the occasional early feature the language as a whole generally acords with the dates of the manuscripts.

\tqt{{[T]}he distinction between the Versions [\eg of Gwynedd, Deheubarth, Gwent] and the Anomalous Laws lies in the existence of a certain pattern according to which it was thought that a wide-ranging account of the Law of Hywel ought to be constructed. The pattern was not immutable, as is shown by the creation of the Test Book in \textsc{Ior} or by the wide variations in the ordering of the tractates in \textsc{Cyfn}.}{charles-edwards_welsh_1989}{26}
