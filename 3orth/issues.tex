\chapter{Some phonological issues}
I argue that a distinction between \lT\ and \xD\ was only maintained word-initially, and only as a result of the morphophonological process of lenition. These two conditions, word-initialness and being part of grammatical lenition, may seem trivial to any educated speaker of Welsh. However, speaker intuitions alone are insufficient on both accounts in making sense of the patterns found in both the phonological part and the orthographical part of my thesis. This chapter will treat both issues.

\section{Exclusively word-initial contrasts and word segmenation}
\label{sec:excl-word-init}
The phonological difference between \lT\ and \xD\ was only maintained word-initially. Word-medially and word-finally, these consonant series must have merged soon after apocope, and possibly even before then. Old Welsh evidence attesting to this merger is discussed in Section~\ref{bdgwithptc}. This finding is backed up by Cornish and Breton: voiced geminates similarly merged with lenited voiceless stops in Cornish and Breton, indicating that this merger most likely occurred as early as the Common Brittonic period~\textcite[31]{schrijver_old_2011}.


So why did \lT\ merge with \xD? And why did it only happen word-medially and word-finally? Martinet convincingly argues how and why this happened in Romance languages, and notes that his arguments are equally applicable to Brittonic. The explanation for this early merger lies in the rarity of voiced geminates both in Brittonic and in Greek, Germanic, and Latin: 

\tqt{Geminated voiced stops [in Brittonic] probably existed, but hardly at other points than at morphemic junctures. The situation must have been very much like the one which prevailed in Latin, where the gemination of surds was common both at the juncture of morphemes (as in \textit{at-tingo, ap-pello}) and elsewhere (as in \textit{bucca, puppa, mitto}), whereas geminated voiced stops were most exceptional except at morpheme juncture (as in \textit{ag-ger, ab-brevio, red-do}). Even here there was a tendency to eliminate them as soon as the feeling for composition became blurred; cf.\ \textit{cred\=o} as opposed to Skt.\ \textit{\c{c}rad-dadh\=ami}, and later \textit{redd\=o > rendo} with dissimilation, probably suggested by \textit{pre(he)nd\=o}; cf.\ also Ital.\ \textit{argine} `dam levee' from \textit{agger} (once \textit{arger}). A very similar situation must have prevailed in classical Greek, where \textit{-ππ-, -ττ-, -κκ-, -πφ-, -τθ-, -κχ-} are frequent (both as the reflexes of normal sound shifts and in hypocoristic formation as a result of some expressive process) but where \textit{-ββ-, -δδ-, -γγ-} are so exceptional nothing prevented the use of \textit{-γγ-} for [ŋg]. A tendency to unvoice geminates must have existed in the older stages of Germanic, at least in cases of expressive gemination, as is shown for instance by the geminated surd of OE \textit{liccian}, OHG \textit{lecch\=on}, as opposed to Goth.\ \textit{bilaigon} (with regular \textit{-g-} from *\textit{-\^gh-}; cf.\ Gk.\ \textit{λείχω}, OIr.\ \textit{ligim}, etc.).}
{martinet_celtic_1952}{198}

The consequence of this development is that \lT\ and \xD\ were only distinguished in those environments where they both appeared with a somewhat comparable frequency: word-initially. In other positions, voiced geminates were so rare that the functional value of a three-way stop distinction would have been minimal, so they merged with lenited voiceless stops. The consequence is that a word like \gpc{*ad-beros} > \pc{*abberos} > \gmw[estuary]{aber} was spelled as \mw{aper} in \gls{ow}, because the word would have merged with a hypothetical \pc{**aperos} by this stage, and because \gls{ow} would orthographically represent any sound existing in a lenited form using its radical counterpart.

\section{The indeterminacy of word separation}
\label{sec:indet-word-separ}
Having established that \lT/\xD\ were only distinguished word-initially, the question arises what exactly this entails. More precisely, this constraint begs the question `what is a word?'.
To a non-linguist, this issue may seem trivial, but linguists have been unable to agree on a cross-linguistic definition of `word'.
\Textcite[28]{haspelmath_indeterminacy_2011} even argues that the whole search for a definition of the concept `word' is because we are biased by writing habits, and he remarks the following: 
% \tqt{Joseph Vendryes remarked that modern linguistics was in a crisis, and that linguists were not even in agreement on what a word is, one of the fundamental concepts of their object of studies.}{haspelmath_indeterminacy_2011}{28}
\tqt{Linguists have no good basis for identifying words across languages, and hence no good basis for a general distinction between syntax and morphology as parts of the language system}{haspelmath_indeterminacy_2011}{24}
What this means is that any formulation of a morphological or syntactical rule may not use the term `word', because it is not a meaningful concept cross-linguistically. 
A quick look at the history of Welsh and a comparison with other Brittonnic languages already reveals inconsistencies in where word boundaries are considered to exist.
A case in point is \gmow[by, against]{erbyn}, a single-word preposition.
This word is reconstructed as \gpbr{ari penn\=u} \autocite[258]{schrijver_studies_1995}, a preposition followed by a noun.
This combination came to be reinterpreted as a compound preposition and finally as a simple preposition.
In \gls{mco}, a trace of the original two-word setup remains, as is borne out by infixed possessive pronouns in \mco[against you, him]{er-dhe-byn, er-y-byn}, \etc~\autocite[120]{koch_neo-brittonic_1989}.

Disambiguating word-internal consonant changes from word-initial mutations cross-linguistically is also a problem \textcite{iosad_right_2010} ran into when presenting an overview of all languages with initial consonant mutations.
He refrains `from considering most cases of consonant alterations involving the left edges of units smaller than the word', as these alternations do not usually target first consonants specifically, and notes that `the majority of these cases do not involve any morphosyntactic information' ~\autocite[108]{iosad_right_2010}.
He then acknowledges immediately that his definition leaves some leeway, and begs the question of what it means to be initial in a word.
He then opts for `an intuitive notion of ``word'' as the actual instantiation of a lexical item, without committing to a particular stance'~\autocite[109]{iosad_right_2010}.
In the end, he gives two useful criteria for diagnosing a word-initial mutation: the morphophonemic process uniquely appears at the beginning of a word, and it is used to convey morphosyntactic information.

This thesis argues that there were plenty of instances where \lT/\xD\ were kept apart, and also plenty of instances where they were not. 
So how do we formulate the limit of the applicability of this phonological distinction?
Such a formulation must be borne out by the evidence. Based on orthographical evidence, \gls{mw} word segmentation agrees largely, but not completely, with where \gls{mow} orthography puts spaces between words.
Still, exceptions exist, \eg \gmow[together]{i gyd} is written as  one word in \gmw{ygyt}.
It is therefore considered a research exception when studying the orthography of lenition.

Crucially, morphemes and lexemes do not exist in isolation. 
Phonemes of the \lT -type only stand in phonemic contrast with \xD\ because a morpheme containing \lT\ coexists with \xT, so the existence of a phrase such as \gmw[his father]{y dad} implies the existence of the lexeme \mw{tad}.
Conversely, the existence of \mw{tad} allows for the phonological interpretation of a phrase containing \lT\ to be maintained as such, so it is due to \mw{tad} that \mw{y dad} may be interpreted as /i \gls{l}tad/ rather than /i \gls{x}dad/.
A similar morphological relationship between phonemes may not be posited for word-medial and word-final consonants, \eg the existence of the word \mw{tad} does not imply the existence of \gmw{**tat} or \mw{**tath}.
Thus, the link maintaining this phonological distinction between different variants of a lexeme does not exist word-medially and word-finally in the same way it does word-initially.

In the case of compound words such as \mw{i gyd} `together', one must keep in mind that they constitute a lexeme of their own. This means that the existence the word \mw{cyd} `joining' does not bear upon the phonological structure of \mw{i gyd} in the same way as \mw{tad} influences \mw{ei dad}.  Thus, a speaker of \gls{mw} could no longer  interpret the phrase \mw{i gyd} as /i \gls{l}kɨd/ rather than /i \gls{x}gɨd/. Instead, a speaker of \gls{mw} would interpret the phrase as one word: /iˈgɨd/, and the opposition between \lT\ and \xD\ did not exist word-internally. In other words: there is no mutation on a synchronic level, because the the petrified mutation does not carry morphophonemic information.

\section{Spirantization and non-word-initial mergers}
\label{sec:spirantization}

I argue that spirantization only happened non-word-initially.
Spirantization is similar to the first merger of \lT/\xD\ in this regard, and its mechanics are therefore of interest to this thesis.
The fact that \gls{mow} still has spirantization as a morphophonemic mutation is because the identification of word boundaries at the time of its phonemicization differs from \gls{mow} orthography.

As noted in Section~\ref{sec:indet-word-separ}, it is impossible to consistently identify word boundaries across languages.
This also means that word boundaries may not be consistent within different stages of a single language.
The consequence of this point is that one may not give different rules for word-internal spirantization and for word-external spirantization without also defining a `word'.
An overview of phonetic contexts in which spirantization occurred is given by \textcite[2--3]{schrijver_spirantization_1999}, and he separately lists external sandhi causing spirantization and internal sandhi.
These lists largely overlap.
Word-external sandhi is the most problematic diachronically, because this is where we see the greatest differences between Welsh and Breton.


\Autocite[\S 24]{evans_grammar_1964} lists the following environments as causing spirantization in  Middle Welsh:
\begin{itemize}
\item possessive pronoun \mw[her]{y}, and its infixed variant \mw[her]{'w};
\item numerals \mw[3]{tri}, \mw[6]{chwech};
\item preposition \mw[over]{tra}, and adverb \mw[very]{tra};
\item conjunction \mw[and, with]{a}, comparative conjunction \mw[than]{no}, and conjunction \mw[neither, nor]{na};
\item negative particles \mw{ny, na}, affirmative particles \mw{neu, ry}, and verbal prefixes \mw{go-, di-, dy-}, \etc;
\item conjunction \mw[if]{o};
\item \mw[where?]{cw}.
\end{itemize}
The same environments also cause spirantization in Breton for the most part.
Additionally,  spirantization is found in \gmob[Easter Sunday]{Sul Fask}, and other close compounds containing a single fixed expression.
Also, \gmob{k} is spirantized after the article in some contexts, \eg \mob[the dog]{ar c'hi}, and \gmob[my]{mo} causes spirantization.
Finally, place names in both Wales and Brittanny have undergone spirantization \eg \mow{Ma-thafarn} in Wales and \mob{Poher} < \lat{pagus} + \ob{kaer} in Brittanny.

None of these environments bar fixed expressions have spirantization following a word in an open word class \ie nouns, verbs, or adverbs.
The fixed expressions of the type of \mob{Sul Fask} may be considered a single word for morphosyntactic purposes, \cf subsection~\ref{sec:petrification}.
The spirant mutation is quite unlike lenition in this respect, considering how the latter may occur \eg following a feminine noun, or in a compound of two nouns. None of the environments above (except perhaps the numerals) may truly be considered words in the sense that they may be used as an independent phrase.
These elements are also typically unstressed, and may therefore be considered an affix to a stressed word.

A separate approach of internal and external spirantization is therefore better abandonded. An alternative view is given by \textcite[126--129]{koch_neo-brittonic_1989}, who does note that `a word boundary is not a phonetic concept'.
He then appeals to prosody: two stressed words which became one single stressed word, such as place name \mw{Mathafarn}, may show spirantization.
Spirantization also occurs with two semantic words, but with only one word accent, \eg \mw[her house]{y ˈthy}.

The fact that we nowadays write a space between conjunctions, articles, and adverbs, \etc and the following word is not grounded linguistically, and spaces may be written elsewhere in other languages, \eg \glat[and men]{virum-que}, Danish \textit{stol-en} `the chair'.
Moreover, verbal prefixes in words such as \mw[take care]{go-chel} are not considered separate words even in Welsh.
If  these elements causing spirantization may not be considered independent words, then spirantization may not be considered a process involving two separate words.
Rather, it may be considered a specific type of internal sandhi where a word takes one of these prefixes.

Most pre-apocope masculine  nouns and adjectives ended in an \pbr{*s}.
We know \gpbr{*s} caused spirantization in several word-medial contexts, yet masculine nouns never cause spirantization.
This lack of spirantization after nouns and adjectives is easily explained if we consider these elements independent words for the purpose of spirantization.
Considering that they are typically stressed and make sense as an independent phrase, the difference between nouns and adjectives on the one hand, and the environments causing spirantization on the other hand, lack of spirantization in the former group can hardly be a coincidence.

These considerations show that the phonological development of spirantization has a lot in common with the merger of \xD/\lT: both occurred at non-phrase initial position, and the combined result of this merger and spirantization entailed the loss of phonemic length in stops non-word-initially.
A final point of similarity is that both innovations occurred in the \gls{pbr} period, after the the Brittonnic-Goidelic split (Goidelic has neither development), but before the split of \gls{pbr} into Welsh, Cornish, and Breton.

\section{Conclusion}
% Perhaps we may turn the question of word segmentation around, and we may answer the question `what is a word?' on the basis of where \lT\ and \xD\ were kept apart. 

Both the problems of word segmentation and lenition --- seemingly very different problems --- lead to the same key in answering their respective issues: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item `Morphophonemic lenition' in \gls{mw} is where both \gls{x}\gls{C}  and \gls{l}\gls{C} are possible initial phonemes of a given morpheme, and where  substitution of either variant phoneme for the other has consequences for the grammaticality or the semantics of a phrase.
    \item A `word' in \gls{mw} is any lexeme which has both \gls{x}\gls{C} and \gls{l}\gls{C} as possible initial phonemes for variant morphemes, and where  substitution of one variant phoneme for another has consequences for a phrase's grammaticality or semantics.
\end{itemize}
This definition of `word' is not a satisfying definition beyond the scope of this thesis, because a strict reading would invalidate any lexeme starting with \mw{s, h, ch, n} or a vowel could not possibly considered a word, because they are not lenitable. It is, however, satisfying as a criterion when deciding what to include in the database of mutations \todo{Reference to database in Appendix}.
