\chapter{Some phonological issues}
I argue that a distinction between \lT\ and \xD\ was only maintained word-initially, and as a result of the morphophonological process of lenition. These two conditions, word-initialness and being part of grammatical lenition, may seem trivial to any educated speaker of Welsh. However, speaker intuitions alone are insufficient on both accounts in making sense of the patterns found in both the phonological part and the orthographical part of my thesis. This chapter will treat both issues.

\section{Exclusively word-initial contrasts and word segmenation}
The phonological difference between \lT\ and \xD\ was only maintained word-initially. Word-medially and word-finally, these consonant series must have merged soon after apocope, and possible even before then. Old Welsh evidence attesting to this merger is discussed in Section~\ref{bdgwithptc}. This finding is backed up by Cornish and Breton: voiced geminates similarly merged with lenited voiceless stops in Cornish and Breton, indicating that this merger most likely occurred as early as the Common Brittonic period~\textcite[31]{schrijver_old_2011}.


So why did \lT\ merge with \xD? And why did it only happen word-medially and word-finally? Martinet convincingly argues how and why this happened in Romance languages, and notes that his arguments are equally applicable to Brittonic. The explanation for this early merger lies in the rarity of voiced geminates both in Brittonic and in Greek, Germanic, and Latin: 

\tqt{Geminated voiced stops [in Brittonic] probably existed, but hardly at other points than at morphemic junctures. The situation must have been very much like the one which prevailed in Latin, where the gemination of surds was common both at the juncture of morphemes (as in \textit{at-tingo, ap-pello}) and elsewhere (as in \textit{bucca, puppa, mitto}), whereas geminated voiced stops were most exceptional except at morpheme juncture (as in \textit{ag-ger, ab-brevio, red-do}). Even here there was a tendency to eliminate them as soon as the feeling for composition became blurred; cf.\ \textit{cred\=o} as opposed to Skt.\ \textit{\c{c}rad-dadh\=ami}, and later \textit{redd\=o > rendo} with dissimilation, probably suggested by \textit{pre(he)nd\=o}; cf.\ also Ital.\ \textit{argine} `dam levee' from \textit{agger} (once \textit{arger}). A very similar situation must have prevailed in classical Greek, where \textit{-ππ-, -ττ-, -κκ-, -πφ-, -τθ-, -κχ-} are frequent (both as the reflexes of normal sound shifts and in hypocoristic formation as a result of some expressive process) but where \textit{-ββ-, -δδ-, -γγ-} are so exceptional nothing prevented the use of \textit{-γγ-} for [ŋg]. A tendency to unvoice geminates must have existed in the older stages of Germanic, at least in cases of expressive gemination, as is shown for instance by the geminated surd of OE \textit{liccian}, OHG \textit{lecch\=on}, as opposed to Goth.\ \textit{bilaigon} (with regular \textit{-g-} from *\textit{-\^gh-}; cf.\ Gk.\ \textit{λείχω}, OIr.\ \textit{ligim}, etc.).}

The consequence of this development is that \lT\ and \xD\ were only distinguished in those environments where they both appeared with a somewhat comparable frequency: word-initially. In other positions, voiced geminates were so rare that there was little reason to maintain a three-way stop distinction, so they merged with lenited voiceless stops. The consequence is that a word like \gpc{*ad-beros} > \pc{*abberos} > \gmw[estuary]{aber} was spelled as \mw{aper} in \gls{ow}, because the word would have merged with a hypothetical \pc{**aperos} by this stage, and because \gls{ow} would orthographically represent any sound existing in a lenited form using its radical counterpart.

\section{The indeterminacy of word separation}
Having established that \lT/\xD\ were only distinguished word-initially, the question arises what exactly this entails. More precisely, this constraint begs the question `what is a word?'. To a non-linguist, this issue may seem trivial, but it is an issue linguists have been unable to agree on. \Textcite[28]{haspelmath_indeterminacy_2011} even argues that the whole search for a definition of the concept `word' is because we are biased by writing habits. He also remarks the following: 
% \tqt{Joseph Vendryes remarked that modern linguistics was in a crisis, and that linguists were not even in agreement on what a word is, one of the fundamental concepts of their object of studies.}{haspelmath_indeterminacy_2011}{28}
\tqt{Linguists have no good basis for identifying words across languages, and hence no good basis for a general distinction between syntax and morphology as parts of the language system}{haspelmath_indeterminacy_2011}{24}
What this means is that any formulation of a morphological or syntactical rule may not use the term `word', because it is not a meaningful concept cross-linguistically. 
Nevertheless, this thesis argues that there were plenty of instances where \lT/\xD\ were kept apart, and also plenty of instances where they were not. 
So how do we formulate the limit of the applicability of this phonological distinction?

Such a formulation must be borne out by the evidence. Based on orthographical evidence, \gls{mw} word segmentation agrees largely, but not completely, with where \gls{mow} orthography puts spaces between words, but exceptions exist, \eg \mw{i gyd} `together' behaves like one word in \gls{mw}.

Another important consideration is that morphemes and lexemes do not exist in isolation. 
It seems that the difference between \lT\ and \xD\ is only phonemic in contexts where the same morpheme exists with \xT, i.e.\ the existence of \mw{tad} `father' implies that a lenited variant of this lexeme must exist, e.g.\ in the phrase \mw{ei dad} `his father'. This allows for the phonological interpretation of a phrase containing \lT\ to be maintained as such, e.g.\ as /i \gls{l}tad/ rather than /i \gls{x}dad/. A similar contrast may not be posited for word-medial and word-final consonants, e.g.\ the existence of the word \mw{tad} does not imply the existence of the word \mw{tat}. Thus, the link maintaining this phonological distinction between different variants of a lexeme does not exist word-medially and word-finally in the same way it does word-initially.

In the case of compound words such as \mw{i gyd} `together', one must keep in mind that they constitute a lexeme of their own. This means that the existence the word \mw{cyd} `joining' does not bear upon the phonological structure of \mw{i gyd} in the same way as \mw{tad} influences \mw{ei dad}. Thus, a speaker of \gls{mw} could no longer to interpret the phrase \mw{i gyd} as /i \gls{l}kɨd/ rather than /i \gls{x}gɨd/. Instead, a speaker of \gls{mw} would interpret the phrase as one word: /iˈgɨd/, and the opposition between \lT\ and \xD\ did not exist word-internally.

\section{Conclusion}
% Perhaps we may turn the question of word segmentation around, and we may answer the question `what is a word?' on the basis of where \lT\ and \xD\ were kept apart. 

Both the problems of word segmentation and lenition --- seemingly very different problems --- lead to the same key in answering their respective issues: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item `Morphophonemic lenition' in \gls{mw} is where both \gls{x}\gls{C}  and \gls{l}\gls{C} are possible initial phonemes of a given morpheme, and where  substitution of either variant phoneme for the other has consequences for the grammaticality or the semantics of a phrase.
    \item A `word' in \gls{mw} is any lexeme which has both \gls{x}\gls{C} and \gls{l}\gls{C} as possible initial phonemes for variant morphemes, and where  substitution of one variant phoneme for another has consequences for a phrase's grammaticality or semantics.
\end{itemize}
This definition of `word' is not a satisfying definition beyond the scope of this thesis, because a strict reading would invalidate any lexeme starting with \mw{s, h, ch, n} or a vowel could not possibly considered a word, because they are not lenitable. It is, however, satisfying as a criterion when deciding what to include in the database of mutations \todo{Give name to database}.
